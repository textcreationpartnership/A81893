         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>There are <hi>Four</hi> very conſiderable things in the Words. 1. The great Work and Buſineſs, that all Chriſts Diſciples and Believers in him are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to, which is to come after him, and to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him; <hi>If any man</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>will come after me, and follow me.</hi> 2ly. The great let and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction that lyeth in the way of ready, reſolute and cheerfull following of Chriſt; and that is a mans own ſelf, or ſelfiſhneſs, which, if it be not removed, laid by, and overcome, in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, he cannot come after Chriſt, nor follow him; <hi>Let him</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>deny himſelf, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me;</hi> 3ly.

Whence, <hi>Obſerve, That oftentimes we may read and diſcern our own corruptions in the diſcoveries of the corruptions of others;</hi> Yea, it is profitable for us ſo to do. Chriſt holds not here at the rebuk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Peter;</hi> but knowing that all had need of the ſame Leſſon, he accordingly teacheth them all; This were a far more profitable way of looking upon the falls and failings of others, to take Warning, and receive Inſtruction to our ſelves from them, than to be rigidly cenſuring them, or to be vainly overvaluing our ſelves, or ſuperciliouſly undervaluing others, becauſe of them; <hi>They were broken off becauſe of unbelief,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, concerning the unbelieving <hi>Jewes</hi>

Or, 3dly. We may conſider it, as it looks to our Lords high Indignation at the nature and kind of the Tentation, as being plaiſtered over with fair words, and ſpecious ſhews of reſpect to him; which Indignation is manifeſted by theſe very
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:135228:9"/> ſharp words, <hi>Get thee behind me Satan;</hi> on which follows the Exhortation, <hi>Then ſaid he,</hi> &amp;c. Whence <hi>Obſerve, That there is no ſort of ſin, and more eſpecially no ſort of ſelfiſhneſs, that Chriſt abhorres more than that which is palliated with pretended reſpect to him:</hi> Albeit <hi>Peter</hi> offered this advice to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, from ſome kind of reſpect to him; yet we will not find a more ſevere check, and ſad re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke given to him, or to any other, than that which he gets here, becauſe ſelfiſhneſs was in his counſel, and the profeſſed reſpect was but carnal and byaſſed; wherein he prefers, either his own, or his Maſters bodily wellfare, to the Will and Honour of God.</p>
            <p>For clearing the <hi>Doctrine</hi> yet a little further, ye may take it up in theſe <hi>two</hi> Branches. 1. <hi>That there is a ſelfiſhneſs, even among Chriſts Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, that comes in, and covers it ſelf with the ſhew of reſpect to Chriſt.</hi> 2ly. <hi>That there is no ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſhneſs more dangerous, and more deteſted, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred of God than this ſort of ſelfiſhneſs.</hi> I ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance the ſubtility, and danger of this ſin of Selfiſhneſs, ſhreuding it ſelf under pretended reſpect to Chriſt ſhortly, in ſome particulars. It comes in, one of <hi>two</hi> ways; either when men do that which is right, as to the matter; and yet it's but Self that they are ſeeking; or when they do that which is wrong; and yet they cover it with profeſt reſpect to God: There are ſeveral kinds of both; <hi>Firſt,</hi> We may ſee it in things lawful, and firſt, in theſe, Men will have a kind of Zeal for God, and yet be ſeeking themſelves; as it was with <hi>Jehu,</hi> who boaſts, that he is zeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for God, and yet in truth, it was moſtly for the Kingdom. 2ly. As Selfiſhneſs vents it ſelf,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:135228:10"/> under the pretence of Zeal, ſo under th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> pretence of honouring God, when yet i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> is only, or mainly reſpect to Mens Selves, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> is ſought after by that pretended reſpect to God; what greater reſpect could readily have been pu upon Chriſt, when ſo deſpiſed by the Rulers, than to offer to make him a King? as the people did, <hi>John</hi> 6. and yet, ſayes he to them, <hi>Ye ſeek me not, becauſe ye ſaw the miracles, but becauſe ye did eat of the loaves, and were filled;</hi> That is, ye ſeek me not out of reſpect to me, as God, but becauſe ye conceive, ye would have a good life under me; for ye think, if I were your King, ye would have an eaſie life of it, and that ye needed not plow, nor ſow, nor work, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways for your Bread; This is a ſubtile ſort of Self-ſeeking, when men profeſs, and pretend to ſeek to have Chriſt Great, and yet in the meantime, there main deſign is to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves great. 3ly. Selfiſhneſs vents it ſelf, in following that which is Duty on the matter, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the pretence of doing it, in obedience to a Command; and yet it is not really the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand that puts on to it, but Self, or Selfiſh reſpect; as the Lord chargeth his profeſſing People, <hi>Zach.</hi> 7. <hi>v.</hi> 5, 6. <hi>When ye did faſt, did ye at all faſt unto me? did ye not do it unto your ſelves:</hi> And, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. <hi>v.</hi> 5. &amp;c. Chriſt charges this on the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> That they gave Almes, Faſted, and made Long-Prayers, as out of obedience to Gods Command; when, in the mean time, all was done <hi>to be ſeen of men. Secondly.</hi> Selfiſhneſs comes in, and vents it ſelf in things unlawful, by cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them with a profeſſed reſpect to Gods ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; as we ſee it was with <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. Who, when he is challenged by <hi>Samuel,</hi> for ſpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:135228:10"/> the beſt of the Cattel, and Sheep, ſayeth, <hi>Theſe are to ſacrifice unto the Lord thy God;</hi> But ſayeth <hi>Samuel, v.</hi> 22. <hi>Obedience is better than ſacrifice, and to hearken, than the fat of rams; for rebellion is as the ſin of witch-craft, and ſtubborn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as iniquity and idolatry:</hi> There is nothing more abominable in the ſight of God, than to ſhreud a ſelfiſh end and deſign, under the ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous pretext of honouring him; But more of this afterward.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Firſt Uſe</hi> of this ſerves for warning, to take good heed to our ſelves, when things look, and promiſe fair, we would try and examine well from what root they ſpring, and on what bottom they ſtand; for many things fair in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, may be rotten and corrupt at the root and bottom; many things may look like reſpect to, and zeal for God, which yet he will reject, and caſt, as proceeding from no true zeal, nor reſpect to him: Therefore in all things, but more eſpecially, in publick matters, do not think, that the honeſting and plaiſtering over of a thing with pretended reſpect to Chriſt, is enough to make it paſſe current: As for inſtance, amongſt the men that have invaded us, there are two things much talked of, and cryed up, and they have indeed a fair outward ſhew, <hi>viz.</hi> The intereſt of Chriſt, and the intereſt of his People, and this they pretend to be the main deſign of their actings, That Chriſts Kingdom may be advanced, and that his People may be the only great men of the World, and the only Rulers of the Kingdom; and this once being pretended as the end and deſign, they are apt to conclude, that there is no mids or mean that
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:135228:11"/> can come readily wrong to compaſſe it by: But if we try this by the Rule, it is to be feared, that there is very little of Chriſts honour, or the true good of his People in the matter; indeed, when men keeping themſelves in their own ſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, are found to have abilities for, and Gods call to Rule and Govern, they are, in that caice, to imbrace that imployment; but while men pretend to exalt Chriſt, and the intereſt of his People, take heed that it be not Self-ſeeking, or ſeeking to make themſelves Great, which is real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly their chiefeſt aim, and that they might have a better life of it: The Intereſt of the People of God, as they are the People of God, never leads them to ſeek after Greatneſs, in reſpect of earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Priviledges and Dignities; Therefore, look well to your ſteps, and upon what principles and grounds ye move toward ſuch an end; and withall, take heed, that in proſecuting this end, ye out-ſhoot not your ſelves, that ye go not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond your line, and that ye move not without your own Sphear; intereſt in Chriſt, and true reſpect to his intereſt, will never prompt, nor nor adviſe you to ſuch exorbitant ſtretches, nor warrand you in the breach of any of his Rules: The paſſions of men <hi>work not the righteouſneſſe of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The 2d. <hi>Uſe,</hi> ſerves to be as a mark and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, whereby we may try, what ſort of duties, actions and worſhip will ſtand before God: none but ſuch as are ſingly for God, and not for our ſelves, as the main end of them; Let the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be never ſo good, if it's end be ſelfie, the more Gods honour be pretended; it is the more abominable in his ſight; for clearing this <hi>Uſe</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>little,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:135228:11"/> ye may take ſome marks of difference, whereby ye ſhall know, when, albeit men cover, and palliat their actions with pretexts of Gods honour, yet Self is their great end. 1. Selfiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs predominantly venting it ſelf in any duty, alters and changes, as it were, the very <hi>nature</hi> of the Duty or Service; in ſomuch as that which is Spiritual Service, when done to Chriſt, is turned into carnal, and meer external ſervice, when done to Self; Thus, thoſe, who (<hi>John</hi> 6,) ſought for their own ſelfiſh ends, to have Chriſt made a King, would have turned Chriſts Spiritual Kingdom into an earthly and worldly Kingdom for their own advantage; it is an evil token, when reſpect to Chriſt is vented carnally in ſome thing that ſmells ſtrong of reſpect to the great Idol of Self. 2ly. As Selfiſhneſs creeping in, changeth ſome way the nature of the Service, ſo it changeth the <hi>manner</hi> and way of ſerving him; There is an unlikeneſs to him in the way of the ſervice, while Chriſt is only pretended, and ſelf indeed intended O! but the manner be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like him; as we may ſee in the Diſciples, <hi>Luke</hi> 9. <hi>v.</hi> 54. When the <hi>Samaritans</hi> refuſed to give Chriſt lodging, <hi>Shall we,</hi> (ſay they) <hi>deſire fire to come down from heaven to conſume them as Elias did?</hi> Was <hi>Elias</hi> thus honoured, and ſhall not our Maſter be as much honoured as he? <hi>ye know not</hi> (ſayes our meek Lord Jeſus to them) what Spirit ye are of; My Spirit (as if he had ſaid) is not firie, as yours i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>;) <hi>The wrath of man fulfills not the righteouſneſs of God:</hi> When there is bitterneſs, even againſt wicked men, look well that it riſe not more from ſome ſelfiſh end or paſſion, and from reſpect to your ſelves,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:135228:12"/> then from real reſpect to Chriſt, however it may be much pretended; for true zeal never vents it ſelf in carnal revenge, or bitterneſs. 3ly. It is unlike Chriſt in the <hi>means;</hi> when Chriſts honour is not ſingly intended, and when men take not Chriſts own way to do his own work; they readily do not light upon, or, are not led into his means to attain that end; or though the end be good, yet they come not to their end, in Chriſts way, and by his means; and be aſſured, when the mids cannot abide the trial, it's a ſhreud evidence, that it's not Chriſt that we are ſeeking, but our ſelves; <hi>we muſt not do ill, that good may come of it;</hi> though the end be appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, if the mids be not approven alſo, Chriſt will caſt ſuch ſervice. But I come now to the <hi>Four</hi> great things in the Text.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Firſt</hi> whereof is, The great taſk or work that Believers are called to, and it is, <hi>to come after Chriſt, and to follow him: If any man</hi> (ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth he) <hi>will come after me, and follow me.</hi> We ſhall ſhortly explain this, to make way for what we aim at, The Words then ſuppoſe, That a man who is a Diſciple of, or a Believer in Chriſt, hath Chriſt before him, and is following after him, for clearing whereof, take this <hi>Doctrine, That a Beltevers great work and task is, in all things wherein he is propoſed as a Pattern, to be a follower of Chriſt, and runner after him;</hi> There are ſeveral general Scriptur-exhortations that hold furth this, as theſe, and ſuch like; <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.1. <hi>Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi> and ſo followers of Chriſt; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.16. <hi>Be ye followers of me;</hi> compared with <hi>Chap.</hi> 11.1. <hi>Be ye followers of me, as I am of Chriſt:</hi> But that
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:135228:12"/> this may be the more clear, I ſhall ſpeak a little to theſe three things. 1. In what reſpects Beli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evers are to look to Chriſt, in following him. 2ly. What is this following of Chriſt? 3ly. What is oppoſite to following of Chriſt?</p>
            <p>For the <hi>Firſt</hi> of theſe, The Scripture holds out Chriſt in ſeveral reſpects, or under ſeveral con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, which will help to clear, what it is to follow h m: And 1. It holds him out, as the <hi>End</hi> and <hi>Scope</hi> that we ſhould have before us, in all our Actions: So 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 15. We ſhould <hi>live to him that died for us;</hi> or, as the <hi>Mark</hi> we aim at, in our Chriſtian race; Thus <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes, <hi>Philip.</hi> 3.14. <hi>I preſs towards the mark, for the prize of the high calling of God in Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> his deſign is to win Chriſt, to know him, and to enjoy him; he is reſtleſs till he be at him; So that following of Chriſt is a running and purſuing cloſs and hard after him, without turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the right or left hand, or looking back, till we be up at him, and fully apprehend him, as our Mark. 2ly. The Scripture holds him out, as the <hi>Prize,</hi> and we are to follow him, as one following after a Prize (as the Apoſtle ſayes he did, <hi>Philip.</hi> 3.14.) <hi>even the prize of the high calling of God in Chriſt;</hi> We are to follow him as our wages, and the reward of all our Service, and as the great mercy, that all Believers mind and long to obtain; I (ſayes the Apoſtle, <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip.</hi> 3.8.) <hi>count all things but dung, that I may win Chriſt.</hi> 3ly. The Scripture holds out Chriſt before us, as a <hi>Patern</hi> and Copple, that we are to conform our ſelves to, in all our Actions, and as the example that we ſhould imitate; which is one of the main things aimed at in this place,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:135228:13"/> and thorow the Scripture, even to draw us to look on Chriſt in his Life, Carriage, Actions, Death and Sufferings; and to imitate him; Chriſt alſo ſuffered for us (ſayes <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 <hi>Eph. Chap.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 22. <hi>Leaving us an example, that we ſhould follow his ſteps;</hi> And ſayes the Lord, <hi>John</hi> 13.10. <hi>I have given you an example, that ye ſhould do as I have done to you,</hi> Believers carriage ſhould be a tranſumpt extract and double of Chriſt; <hi>Learn of me</hi> (ſayeth he, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.29.) <hi>for I am meek and lowly in heart:</hi> We ſhould prefer his will to our will, as he did the Fathers; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tender hearted, meek, lowly, humble, as he was, in ſuffering, to deny, and lay aſide our ſelves, as he did, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 4ly. Chriſt Jeſus is held out, as a <hi>Maſter</hi> and <hi>Teacher,</hi> and ſo we are to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him, as one that teacheth us what to do; whether it be as a Teacher that Inſtructs, or as a Maſter that directs what to do. <hi>Ye call me</hi> (ſayeth he, <hi>John</hi> 13.13.) <hi>Maſter and Lord, and ye ſay well, for ſo I am.</hi> 5ly. He is held out to us as a <hi>Leader,</hi> or guide in our way; and ſo we are to follow him; <hi>Behold,</hi> (ſayeth the Lord, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.4.) <hi>I have given him for a witneſs to the people, a leader and commander to the people.</hi> 6ly He is ſet out as a <hi>Captain</hi> and <hi>Commander;</hi> ſo he is called, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10 <hi>The captain of our ſalvation,</hi> and <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.4. a <hi>Commander;</hi> Souldiers take Orders from their Commanders, and muſt keep their Rank and File, and when they ſcale the Walls of a Town, and offer to take it by ſtorm, they muſt follow their Commanders cloſs at the back; even ſo ſhould we follow Chriſt. 7ly. The Scripture ſets out Chriſt as the <hi>Shepherd</hi> that cares for the Sheep, that waits upon, and ſeeds
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:135228:13"/> his People. <hi>I am</hi> (ſayes he, <hi>John</hi> 10.) <hi>the good ſhepherd; and when he goes furth, his ſheep follow him, v.</hi> 4. Not only muſt they take their Directions from him, as a Commander, but they muſt keep neer his feet, hear what Leſſons he gives out to them, and hide themſelves under his ſhaddow, from them that come to trouble his flock. 8ly. He is held out to us as our <hi>Fore-runner. Heb.</hi> 6.20. <hi>Whither the fore-runner is for us entered;</hi> as our heavenly harbinger, he is gone to Heaven before us, to take up our lodging, to provide quarters for us; and we are called to have our converſation in Heaven, as he is exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Heaven, our converſation ſhould be in Heaven alſo, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 3.1. and <hi>Philip.</hi> 3.18. 9ly. He is held out to us as the <hi>Author and finiſher of our faith,</hi> as he that works all our works in us, and for us, as he that muſt give us the Leſſon, and underſtanding to take it up, make the way plain, and carry us thorow it; <hi>Looking</hi> (ſayes the Apoſtle. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.2. <hi>unto Jeſus the Author and finiſher of our faith,</hi> Giving him the truſt of carrying us thorow, Theſe <hi>two</hi> words bid us truſt Chriſt with the beginning and perfecting of the work, &amp; never to take our eye off from him.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>Second,</hi> What this following is, 1. It will be the more clear by ſhewing you, what it is oppoſed unto. And firſt, it is oppoſed to mens taking of another way than Chriſt took, and to the taking of another Guide, or Leader than him; for whoſoever follows a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, they follow not him, 2ly. It is oppoſed to mens turning of their backs on Chriſt; for fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing ſuppoſeth the ſetting of the f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>IT is not eaſie, but a matter of ſingular difficultie, ſincerely and honeſtly to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Chriſt; As is clear from the high and hard Duties which Our Lord calls for in theſe Words, as ſimply, and indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſably neceſſary to the following of Him, <hi>viz.</hi> That a man deny himſelf, and Willingly and Cheerfully take up his Croſs.</p>
            <p>In this part of the <hi>Verſe</hi> (as we formerly ſhew) there are <hi>Four</hi> things contained. The 1. is the Great Work and Buſineſs that all that comes after Chriſt, or are Chriſts Diſciples are called to; and that is, to <hi>follow him.</hi> 2ly. There is the great Obſtruction that lyes in the way of this, or that hinders Believers in following of him; and that is a mans <hi>own ſelf,</hi> or felfiſhneſs. 3ly. There are the great qualifications, or duties which are required in, and from Chriſts Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, in order to their following of him; they muſt <hi>deny themſelves,</hi> and <hi>take up their croſs,</hi> and ſo <hi>follow him;</hi> and theſe are helpful to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Self-denial helps to contented and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full cloſeing with the Croſs; and that again pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves greatly helpful to the following of Chriſt. 4ly. There is the great neceſſity of theſe qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, or duties, to all and every one that
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:135228:15"/> would follow Chriſt; they are ſo indiſpenſably ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, that there can be no following of him, without them; all that would follow him, muſt needs deny themſelves, and take up their croſs.</p>
            <p>For making way to what we principally aim at, ſomewhat hath been ſpoken in ſhort, to the <hi>Firſt</hi> of theſe, and we ſhall not inſiſt further on it, eſpecially ſeing what reſpects the following of Chriſt may fall in afterward, amongſt the Duties that are required of theſe that come after him.</p>
            <p>I ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ll therefore come to the <hi>Second</hi> thing <hi>viz.</hi> The great Obſtruction that hinders Believers in the following of Chriſt, whether we ſpeak with reſpect to the matter, or manner of this full and comprehenſive Dutie; which is (as we ſaid) a mans Self, or ſelfiſhneſs. Hence,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſerve, That a mans own ſelf, or ſelfiſhneſs is the great thing that obſtructs Chriſts followers, and hinders them in the following of him;</hi> This is that which makes them ſtumble, and fall in their way, ſo that if it be not in ſome meaſure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, and rolled out of the way, there can be no following of Chriſt: This is clearly ſuppoſed in theſe Words; for if Self did not obſtruct in the following of Chriſt, he needed not have preſſed this great Dutie of Self-denial, as neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to the following of him: But that we may the better clear this <hi>Doctrine,</hi> we ſhall take it up in theſe <hi>three</hi> Branches, which are manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuppoſed, and implyed in the Words, and in the Doctrine. 1. That there is ſuch a corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as Self in, and among Chriſts own Diſciples, and Followers; for to them he ſpeaks, and on them, he preſſes this duty of ſelf-denyal, ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they, even they had ſuch a corruption in
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:135228:15"/> them, as Self, and might be too much ſwayed by it. 2ly. That this Corruption goes alongſt with, and waits upon Believers, in their fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing of Chriſt; nay, alas! it ſteals in upon them, and twiſts it ſelf in, into their moſt ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Duties; and therefore Chriſt knowing this, preſſes the ſtudy of Self-denial, in order to their right following of him, in the way of Duty. 3ly. That this Corruption (at leaſt where it bears ſwey) is the great thing that obſtructs, letts, and impeds Believers in their following of Chriſt, and in their Dutie, and therefore when he is giving Direction, how people may get him followed, he firſt propoſes the removal of Self out of the way, as the great thing that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructs following of him.</p>
            <p>For clearing and confirming of the <hi>firſt</hi> of theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> That there is ſuch a Corruption as Self in, and among Chriſts own Diſciples, and Followers; there are <hi>three</hi> things that we ſhal ſpeak a little to. 1. What is to be underſtood here by a <hi>Mans Self,</hi> or what it is that we call Selfiſhneſs. 2ly. What makes it out, that this Corruption of Selfiſhneſs is in, and amongſt Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, or Chriſts followers. 3ly Why the Lord ſuffers Believers to be ſo much kept at un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with ſuch a groſs Corruption.</p>
            <p>For clearing of the <hi>first</hi> of theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> What is to be underſtood here, by a mans Self, or what it is that we call Selfiſhneſſe, we ſhall offer theſe <hi>four</hi> things to be conſidered. 1. What uſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to be called a Mans Self; In the General it comprehends what is in Man, whatſoever a man is of himſelf; but more particularly. 1. It is taken for that habitual Corruption of nature that
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:135228:16"/> it is in all and every one; which the Apoſtle calls <hi>Fleſh, Rom.</hi> 8.8 <hi>The old man, Epheſ.</hi> 4.22. <hi>The body of death, Rom.</hi> 7.24 And this is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called <hi>ſinfull or corrupt ſelf.</hi> 2ly. It is taken for a mans natural affection, and deſire to his own being and well-being, for his natural deſire to preſerve himſelf, and his deſire towards theſe things that tend thereunto, and to his well-being; for as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.29. <hi>No man ever yet hated his own fleſh, but nouriſheth it, and cheriſheth it;</hi> And we find this affection to our ſelves, made the meaſure of our love to our neighbour; and therefore the Scripture ſays, <hi>Thou ſhalt love thy neighbour as thy ſelf;</hi> This is called <hi>naturall Self.</hi> 3ly. It is taken for a mans Parts, Gifts, Moral Induements, Meekneſs, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, Fortitude, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or his outward moral actions whereby he commends himſelf to others; Hence a man is ſaid to <hi>follow himſelf,</hi> when he walks according to his own wiſdom and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell; and to <hi>truſt in himſelf,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.9. When he truſts in his own wiſdom, ſtrength, courage, moral blameleſſneſs, or the like; This is called <hi>morall ſelf.</hi> 4ly. It is taken for theſe Graces of of the Spirit, whereby a man is renewed after the image of God; and in this reſpect, a man is oppoſed to his own corrupt Self, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.20. <hi>It is no more I that do it, but ſin that dwelleth in m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> and <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. <hi>I live, yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me;</hi> And this may be called <hi>Spirituall, Sanctified,</hi> or <hi>Renewed-Self:</hi> now all theſe point at ſomething habitu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l in the man; but when we ſay that Self obſtructs in following of Chriſt; we underſtand it not ſimply, with reſpect to any of theſe laſt three, nay, not with reſpect to the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:135228:16"/> 
               <hi>firſt,</hi> at leaſt as more properly conſidered; for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t is not the having of Grace, and moral Parts, or gifts of Wiſdom and Learning, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nor a mans natural affection, and deſire to his own being, and well-being, that (conſidered in themſelves) obſtruct his following of Chriſt; but the mans undue eſtimation of theſe, and their bearing the great ſway with him in his car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage: and though the corruption of nature does greatly obſtruct the following of Chriſt, and is the bitter root, out from which the Selfiſhneſs we here ſpeak of ſprings; yet it is ſomeway diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct from it, I mean, from that habitual, and (to ſpeak ſo) complex body of natural cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption in us, which (as we ſaid) is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called <hi>ſinfull or corrupt ſelf;</hi> but that which we ſpeak of, is a ſpecial propenſion and inclination in all men to miſcarry, by an inordinate reſpect to themſelves, and to theſe things that reſpect themſelves. Conſider, 2ly. That this Selfiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs may be looked on, other more <hi>generally,</hi> or more <hi>particularly.</hi> 1. More <hi>generally,</hi> it may be looked on, as it goes thorow the whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation and actions of a man; and as it is in every man the ſame; for all men naturally have the ſame principle of Selfiſhneſs, or of inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat reſpect to themſelves, ſwaying them in the whole of their converſation and actions. 2ly. More <hi>particularly,</hi> it may be looked on as it runs in ſuch and ſuch a channel, and eſpecially vents it ſelf in this or that particular way, or towards ſuch or ſuch a particular ſin, or idol; and in this reſpect it differs much amongſt men; the Selfiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of one man venting more in one way, and towards one thing, and the Selfiſhneſs of another
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:135228:17"/> man, venting more another way, and toward ſome other thing; and when we ſpeak of Selfiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs here, it is not of the laſt, but of the firſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of theſe that we mean; that is of that ſelfiſh pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion, or inordinat reſpect to a mans Self that ſwayes a man in the whole of his converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and is the ſame in all men, whatever more ſpecial and particular wayes it has of venting it ſelf amongſt men: for though the ſins and evils whereunto men are particularly addicted be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, yet the corruption that ſwayes to all theſe is one and the ſame. <hi>Conſider,</hi> 3ly. That this inordinat reſpect to a mans Self, that ſwayes him in all his actions, and makes him miſcarry in reference to himſelf, may be looked on again <hi>two</hi> wayes; either <hi>firſt,</hi> As it is oppoſed to the things of others, as when a man ſees to his own things, and not to the things of another, and this is called <hi>particularneſs,</hi> or <hi>particularity,</hi> and is expr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſly prohibit by the Apoſtle, <hi>Philip.</hi> 2.4. <hi>Look not every man on his own things, but every man alſo on the things of others.</hi> 2ly. As it is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to God, and the things of God (in which ſenſe we principally ſpeak of it here;) For, whereas a man ſhould keep himſelf, and all that concerns himſelf in ſubordination to God, this inordinat reſpect to himſelf, makes him put himſelf, or ſomething in or belonging to himſelf, out of the right place, or out of that place of ſubordination to God, that he ſhould keep him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in; and makes him put himſelf in Gods place and room: So that from all this it may be clear, that by the Selfiſhneſs we here ſpeak of, we are not ſimply to underſtand that habitual corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of nature, or this, and that particular Luſt,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:135228:17"/> that this or that man may be more peculiarly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>For the 3d. thing which we propoſed to be ſpoken to, on this branch of the Doctrine, <hi>viz.</hi> Why does the Lord ſuffer Believers to be ſo much kept at under, with ſuch a groſs corruption, as Self, or Selfineſs? In anſwer to this queſtion, there are theſe few reaſons, or ends which we ſhall offer, The 1. whereof is, that he may make and keep humble his own Followers; that the continual ſight of this Corruption, and the ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of it, may put, and keep them in mind of the remainder of corrupt nature, that is yet in them, and may prevent dotting upon any Gifts, or Graces in themſelves; for this end then, <hi>viz.</hi> to diſcover what venom lurks in their nature, to prevent pride, and keep humble, there is ſomething of this vile corruption left, and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſtir them, ye ſee, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. <hi>A meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:135228:21"/> of Satan is ſent to buffet Paul, leaſt he ſhould be puffed up, or exalted above meaſure, thorow the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundance of revelations;</hi> Intimating thereby, that there was a hazard of being puffed up; and to prevent that, a meſſenger of Satan was ſent to buffet him; I will not ſay that this corruption of Self was the Scourge, that was ſent to humble him, but it is clear, that the quickneſſe, and livelineſſe of this corruption of Self, was the cauſe why this meſſenger of Satan was ſent to buffet him, in order to the keeping of him hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and Self-denyed. A 2d. Reaſon, or end is, That the Lord thereby, may quicken his own People, to more lively exerciſe of their Grace, when they know that there is ſuch an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in their boſom, as no natural thing, or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in nature can ingadge and ſway them to fight againſt; For, what is there, I pray, in any man naturally to engadge him, or to help him to fight againſt Self? nay, nothing can do this, but ſupernatural ſpecial Grace; and even that will not do it to any good purpoſe, if it be not keept in lively exerciſe; and therefore (I ſay) that the Lord may quicken, and ſtir up Believers to the lively exerciſe of Grace, he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers this Corruption to be in them, and to ſtir, and now and then to move more ſtrongly in them, that thereby he may neceſſitat them thereto; and no doubt, by fighting ſeriouſly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this Corruption, Believers not only evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence the truth of their Grace, but the livelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it, and much ſincere reſpect to God; as we ſee in <hi>Abrahams</hi> caſe, to whom the Lord ſays, <hi>Now I know that thou feareſt God, in that thou haſt not withheld thy ſon, thine on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:135228:22"/> not ſimply the offering of his Son, but his only Son, the Son of his Love, that evidenced the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his reſpect and love to God. A 3d. Reaſon, or End is, That God thereby may fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and promote the mortification of this Corruption, and make his People fall out with themſelves the more; he does not only ſuffer it to be in them but he will ſuffer it ſometimes to ſtir ſtrongly in them, to vex and trouble them, and to keep them at under, that they may be the more ſtirred up againſt it, and made the more to ſtudy the mortification of it; though it be in them, yet if it lay quiet, and did never ſtir, and move ſtrongly to the obſtructing of them in their following of Chriſt, it might get leave to live in them, without ſuch vigorous op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; but when it moves ſtrongly, and ſtands up in the Believers face, and comes in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him in all duties, ſeeking to corrupt them; It cannot but provock him the more againſt it, and ſtir him up more ſeriouſly to endeavour the mortification of it: and therefore we find, that our Lord Jeſus would have Believers taking oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion from the ſtirring of their corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to fall on it, and to ſeek to have the v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

A 4th Reaſon is, That God may teach his People to know how little they
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:135228:22"/> are oblidged to themſelves, and how much they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d; and indeed there is not any one thing that inordinat reſpect to Self, doth readily ſwey men more to than this. 3ly. Though a man cannot reach either of theſe, to be ſomething, or to be eſteemed ſomething in the world; yet then Self will ſwey a man at laſt, to think ſomething of himſelf, when he cannot get eſteem from others, or when the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:135228:23"/> eſteem others has had of him is loſt; yet, even then this Corruption can make that a ground whereupon to put a man to think ſomething of himſelf; when one Idol is broken, it makes him ſet up another; yea, it may be to think the more of himſelf, becauſe others think little of him: yea, his eſteem of himſelf may flow, not ſo much from what is external, as from what is internal and ſpiritual, and lyes betwixt God and him, and ſo it becomes the more dangerous; we find that even <hi>Paul</hi> was in ſome hazard of an undue eſteem of himſelf, upon the account of what was between God and him. 2. <hi>Cor</hi> 12. 4ly. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinat reſpect to ſelf, leads a man to ſtudy to promote, and uphold all theſe; that is, his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſomething, his being eſteemed ſomething, and his own eſtimation of himſelf as ſomething, even when he is at a loſs in that amongſt others; and this comes in as a mids, or mean unto theſe, as the end; It makes a man leave nothing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, that may contribute any thing unto theſe; and will ſuffer him to do nothing that may be oppoſite, or croſs to theſe: ye ſee, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.3. how far Self will go, in ſeeking to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain an eſteem amongſt others, or a mans eſteem of himſelf; it will even put him to give his body to be burn'd; and we ſee what the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.12. Of falſe Teachers, that loved their own outward eaſe, peace, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and eſtimation ſo well, that for prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the breach, and interruption thereof, by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, and that they might be in eſteem, (eſpecially with the <hi>Jewes</hi>) They urged, and preſſed circumciſion; <hi>As many</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>as deſire to make a fair ſhew in the fleſh, they conſtrain
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:135228:24"/> you to be circumciſed, only leaſt they ſhould ſuffer perſecution for the croſs of Chriſt:</hi> So then the moſt part of a mans actions, in ſo far as he is Selfie, are directed to one, or all of theſe ends; either to be ſomething, or to be eſteemed ſomething, or to keep up an eſtimation of himſelf, when the other two fail.</p>
            <p>For the 2d. thing, <hi>viz</hi> How this Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may be diſcerned, or taken up? ye may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider theſe things for helping to it. 1. If men be doing the Duties they ſhould do without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to theſe ends, or without expectation of coming to be ſomething in the world, or of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit and eſtimation, by following of them, yea, with an expectation of the contrary, even of the Croſs of Chriſt in following them; This is an evidence that Self carries not the ſwey; for when it bears the ſwey, Duties are followed with reſpect to theſe Selfie ends, and are deſerted and forſaken, when theſe ends are not attainable by them: Our Lord ſays, <hi>John</hi> 6.26. To ſome that followed him, <hi>Ye ſeek me not becauſe ye ſaw the miracles, but becauſe ye did eat of the loaves, and were filled;</hi> As if he had ſaid, if ye had not gotten ſome temporal good by following of me, ye would not have followed me; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when he preaches of Bread of another na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, than that which nouriſheth the Body, they forſook him: we may alſo ſee ſomewhat of it in <hi>Jonah,</hi> who fearing to loſe his credit, fled to <hi>Tarſhiſh,</hi> whereas, if there had been ground to have expected reput and credit, he had readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly been as forward as any to go to <hi>Ninieveh</hi> on Gods call. 2ly.

A 3d way to diſcern when Self ſweyes, is by the carnal anxiety, perplexity, grief, and diſquietneſs, (which are the effects and fruits of it) that men have, when they miſs their ſelfy end: we have had, it's very probable, ſome expectation of peace, and of the thriving and proſpering of Gods Work; and that it would have brought Miniſters and Profeſſors in eſtimation; try what fruit and effect follows our diſappointment; if it be carnal anxiety, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietneſs, it ſays, Self hes born much ſway with us; as we ſee it did with <hi>Baruch,</hi> by this very effect and fruit of it. <hi>Jer.</hi> 45.3.5. He cryes, <hi>Wo is me, for the Lord hath added grief to my ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, I fainted in my ſighing, and found no reſt;</hi> It might have been thought, that this was ſome holy grief, and affectedneſs of Soul, for the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:135228:25"/> of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> But the Lords anſwer, <hi>Seeks thou great things for thy ſelf,</hi> ſhews, that the ground of his ſorrow was more Selfie, and that his diſqu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>etnsſs, was but a Selfie diſquietneſs in a great meaſure, at leaſt; becauſe he was like to be diſappointed of the great things he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected: We had need to conſider well, what the nature of our grief is, and on what grounds we are diſquieted in ſad times; whether it be mainly, for ſomething that concerns our ſelves, or for that which concerns the work, and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God. 4ly. It may be diſcerned when ſelf bears ſwey, by a willingneſs, and earneſtneſs to have any thing that may ſerve theſe ends, we ſpoke of, followed forth; as when perſons would have their good ſpoken of, &amp; commended: &amp; any evil that may mar their to much coveted eſteem covered; In oppoſition to which the Apoſtle ſays, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.6. <hi>I forbear least any man ſhould think of me above that which he ſeeth me to be;</hi> Being a ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed man, as he, keept in (as it were) and cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the good which he had; ſo the ſelfie man cares not how many know the good that is in him, nay, he is deſirous, that many may know of it. 5ly. It may be diſcerned, when Self ſwayes; if men would obſerve their thoughts, contryvances, projects and deſigns, it will readily be found, that there are many of them imaginary and vain; examine but the current of them, and it will be found, that they are taken up with that which is pleaſant, or profitable to Self: and alas! the great ſcope of the moſt of People, in all their deſigns, and endeavours, yea, in all they do, or ſay, is Self; And as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſays, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 6.7. <hi>All the labour of a man is for his mouth;</hi> So we
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:135228:25"/> may ſay, that our back, or belly, our credit, or name, our eaſe, or pleaſure, or one thing or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, concerning Self, takes us up, and that all our labour is ſpent in ſerving of it; this is the Fruit, the bitter Fruit of that Corruption that dwelleth in us.</p>
            <p>The 2d. <hi>Uſe</hi> ſerves to humble all fleſh, that there is ſuch a corrupt principle in us: And <hi>firſt,</hi> If there be ſuch ſelfiſhneſs, and oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to God, even amongſt Chriſts followers, then what ever their parts, and gifts be, what ever their graces, and nearneſs to God be, it becomes all of them to be humble, when they think on this ſinful inclination, that is in them, to ſet up themſelves in Gods place, and to get up, as it were, into his Chair; and that ye may ſtand in awe, and be humbled, when ye think on this Corruption; conſider what things it has in it; as 1. An horrible guiltineſs, which might fill us with fear, and terror, and put us to tremble; there is no guilt like it in other Corruptions, this is the very height of guiltineſſe, being Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie, a mans putting himſelf where God ſhould be; and accordingly, all the heavy threatnings, and plagues of God, becauſe of Idolatrie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to it. 2ly That this is not a ſimple act of Idolatry, as the making, and the worſhipping of the Calf in the Wilderneſs was, but it is an ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual continued tract of Idolatrie; It is our ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry nature, to be Idolatrous this way; and we are as much; and as often Idolatrous, as we are only, or mainly for our ſelves, and ſwayed by Self; yea, it goes alongſt the whole courſe of our life; and if one Idolatrous Act ſhould hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble us, much more ſhould a tract of Idolatry,

            <p>For further clearing of this Branch of the <hi>Doctrine,</hi> there are <hi>two</hi> things which I ſhall ſpeak a little to. 1. To ſome particular inſtances, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:135228:28"/> wherein this Corruption of <hi>Self</hi> comes in, an inſinuates it ſelf upon men, and even upon Be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lievers. 2dly. I ſhall ſhew you, how it comes t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> paſs, and whence it proceeds, that this Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doth ſo inſinuat it ſelf upon them, an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gers footing in them, in all that they do.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>first</hi> of theſe, there are many par<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ticular inſtances, that may be given of Se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fs com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing in upon men, and even upon Believers, in following their Duty, and that either more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernably, and palpably, or more ſecretly, and ſubtilly; but we ſhall touch upon theſe few, as namely. 1. In Peoples cloſing with, and mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing uſe of Chriſt by Faith, that is a Duty upon which all other Duties depend, and here Self comes in to obſtruct this greatly. For, 1. If we look to our Juſtification before God, which is only by Faith, cloſing with, and reſting upon Chriſts Righteouſneſs, and upon nothing in our ſelves, we will find, that Self endeavours to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct this; for we are keeped back from cloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with, and reſting upon Chriſts Righteouſneſs, for Juſtification, from an inordinat reſpect to, and confidence in our own Righteouſneſs; as is clear from, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.3. Where it is ſaid of the zealous <hi>Jews, that being ignorant of Gods righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and going about to eſtabliſh their own righteouſneſs, they did not ſubmit to the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God;</hi> It was reſpect to their own Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, and their ſolicitude, how to eſtabliſh that which keeped them from ſubmitting to Chriſts Righteouſneſs, 2dly. If we look to the Believers uſe-making of Chriſt by Faith, after Juſtification, and here Self ſeeks to come in, ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſhare, and partake with Faith; it comes
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:135228:28"/> in and greatly obſtructs their uſe-making of him by Faith, for Light, Life and Strength, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for Dutie, and for the ſupply of their wants, and leads them in into themſelves for theſe; yea, it comes in, and greatly obſtructs their uſe make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him, for peace and acceptance with God, and in order thereunto, (ſometimes at leaſt) it makes them ſeek to commend themſelves to God, either by ſome good internal qualification, or by their external Duties, and their tender, and holy walk: And therefore in oppoſition to this, we find, that as the Apoſtle counted all his parts, gifts, external priviledges, and blameleſſneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Converſion, to be but loſs, not only uſeleſs, but prejudicial and hurtful in the matter of Juſtification before God; So likewiſe doth he account his moſt ſpiritual duties, after Converſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and ſeeks not by them, to commend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to God, as expecting favour and acceptance with him, upon their account, as is clear, from <hi>Philip.</hi> 3.7, 8, 9. Where ſpeaking in reference to the time paſt, he ſayes, <hi>v.</hi> 7. <hi>What things were gain to me, theſe I counted loſs for Chriſt;</hi> and as to the time preſent, and even with reſpect to his Graces, and ſpiritual Duties, he ſayes, <hi>v.</hi> 8. <hi>Yea, doubtleſs I count all things but loſs, for the excellencie of the knowledge of Chriſt Jeſus my Lord, that I may be found in him, not having my own righteouſneſs</hi> (whether before, or after Converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) <hi>which is according to the Law,</hi> &amp;c. Where it is plainly his Scope and Deſign, to ſhew that as he would reſt on none of thoſe, as to the found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his peace and acceptance before God; ſo he found in ſome reſpect, what he had of theſe, through a remainder of this woful Self, a great
<pb facs="tcp:135228:29"/> obſtruction to him, in his uſe-making of Chriſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Righteouſneſs for this end, and was thereby in ſo far to count them to be but <hi>loſs.</hi> 2ly. This may be inſtructed, not only in the matter o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Faith, but in all our actions, and in the whole of our Converſation, and in all thoſe actions, wherein we are called to follow Chriſt dayly, in which Self inſinuats, even upon Believ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

In his foul Act of denying Chriſt, notwithſtanding of his fair undertaking. 4ly.

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:135228:29"/> moved him to diſſemble; ſo that whether a man <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

It's wayes are move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able;</hi> and as Satan, when he aſſaulted our Lord, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. changed his temptations on him, and took different wayes to prevail with him; ſo doth <hi>Self;</hi> when a man falls ſhort of one deſign, it will put him on another; when he miſſeth rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, it will put him to ſeek after credit; and if he fail, and come ſhort of both, it will ſet him on to ſeek his own eaſe, quietneſs and pleaſure, in a more privat way. 3ly. It proves reſtleſs, and makes the man whom it ſweys, reſtleſs, and unceſſant in his way; it diſquiets and vexes him, whatever he do, or whitherſoever he go, ſo long as it's deſigns and ends are not attained, and accompliſhed (which they never will be) This Self is never at eaſe, when (to ſpeak ſo) it gets not it ſelf, when it reacheth not the thing it would be at: we ſee an inſtance of this in <hi>Jonah;</hi> but amoſt remarkable one in <hi>Balaam, Numb.</hi> 22. One anſwer from the Lord will not ſatisfie him, but again he muſt go and conſult him; having a Selfie deſign, and deſire after <hi>Balacks</hi> ſilver and gold, which he largely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed him, if he would come and curſe <hi>Iſrael,</hi> it would not ſuffer him to reſt and ſit at home: Since then this Corruption takes ſuch ſubtile wayes to bear in it ſelf upon us; It is no great wonder, that through our unwatchfulneſs and ignorance, or non-conſideration of it's devices, and wiles, it prevail ſo much over us, in all that we go about. But 3ly. If in a word, we add to theſe the conſideration of the aptneſs, pron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſtrong propenſion of our nature, to reſet, harbour, intertain, and cheriſh this Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:135228:34"/> of Self, beſide our unwatchfulneſs, in circumſpection, and negligence to obſerve, and guard againſt it; Is it any great wonder, that it gets ſo much way, and prevails ſo much over us in all that we go about?</p>
            <p>The <hi>Uſes</hi> of the Point are <hi>Three,</hi> the <hi>firſt,</hi> whereof is, That ſeing this Corruption doth thus ſteal in upon the followers of Chriſt, in all they do; then ſure it ſhould make all fear and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble becauſe of it; eſpecially, when we come to meddle in theſe things which more immediatly concern God; we would alwayes think of, and keep this in our eye, that we may be in duties of worſhip to God, even the moſt ſpiritual and lively of them, and yet have nothing to boaſt of before him, becauſe in them we act much from Self and to Self, and are very like to <hi>Ephraim;</hi> the beſt bringing forth fruit in a great meaſure to themſelves; yea, we would conſider, that we may begin well to a duty, and yet before the cloſe of it, this Corruption may ſo twiſt it ſelf with the dutie, as utterly to ſpoil and corrupt all, or in a great meaſure: There is therefore ſo much the more need to walk in fear of it; and ſeing <hi>Adam</hi> was ſtollen off his feet, by a Tentation to this ſin, when there was no ſin nor corruption in him before, how much greater muſt needs the hazard of all his poſterity be? and how very much are we concerned, and called to walk up and down in much fear and trembling, in much holy jealouſie over our ſelves, leaſt we be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, or much influenced, and ſweyed by this corruption, in what we do: if the great hazard that weare in from this corrupt Self, were more thorowly believed, and more ſeriouſly ponde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:135228:34"/> we would be more convinced of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of walking ſoftly, of living near God, and of making much uſe of Chriſt, for the ſubduing of it, and of all our other Corruptions.</p>
            <p>The 2d. Uſe ſerves to exhort us to learn, not to Judge of our ſelves, by our own actions ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, nor of our actions by the ſubſtance, or matter of them, but to judge of them, as they partake of, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:135228:35"/> Selfieneſs in ſpiritual Duties, appears by this, when a man is not the better of his Duties, but is as vain, light, frothy, carnal and corrupt after them, as he was before, he fell about them; as for inſtance, when a man is not the better of Prayer, but is as vain, frothy and carnal, and his corruption, as little mortified after it, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he went about it; as it was with theſe of whom the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 3. <hi>Who asked and received not, becauſe they asked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs, to conſum it upon their luſts;</hi> They were not the better of their Prayers, they did not mortifie corruption; ye may ſee the like in the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> who, though <hi>they made long prayers,</hi> as it is, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.14. Yet they were not the better of them, but as our Lord ſpeaks, <hi>verſe</hi> 27. <hi>They were like whited ſepulchres, which indeed appear beautifull outward, but are within full of dead mens bones, and of all uncleanneſs:</hi> In ſhort then, when people are much in Duty, and yet they are not ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally bettered by Duty, but their Spirits remain vain, frothy, and carnal, it is an evidence, that Self predomines, or carries the great ſwey in their Duties, but when they are bettered, and ſuch an evil frame (as we juſt now ſpoke of) in ſome meaſure got helped, and the Soul made more ſtayed, humble, and ſpiritual, it evidenc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a denyed way of following Duty; ſingleneſs in Duty, ordinarly humbles and leaves the Soul in ſome better frame than it found it. 2ly. A regnant Selfie way of following Duty, is never waited upon with ſolid ſpiritual peace; a man that is mainly ſweyed, and ruled by this Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt principle in Duty, may have a ſtrong con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, that his way is good, and as he gets ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:135228:35"/> may grow to a great height of carnal ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity; but as he hath no peace with God, ſo neither hath he any ſolid ſpiritual Peace in his own Conſcience, in the performance of Duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; for when Selfineſs predomines, or prevails, it obſtructs the ſweet influence which otherways duties might have upon the Souls Spiritual Peace; whilſt <hi>Ephraim brought forth fruit to himſelf;</hi> he was but <hi>an empty vine,</hi> that neither brought forth acceptable, and pleaſant fruit to God, nor ſuch as could have any influence on his own ſolid ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual peace, but the ſingle, and Self-denyed way of following Duties, much quiets the Soul, and hes ſweet influence on the ſolid ſpiritual peace thereof: Thus we ſee, <hi>Phili.</hi> 4.6, 7. That <hi>the peace of God which keeps or guards the heart and mind through Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> is the ſweet fruit, if not being in a carnal and Selfie way careful for any thing, and of making our requeſts ſingly known to God, by Prayer, and Supplication, with thanks giving. A 3d. evidence of it is, when a man, not only hath no ſolid ſpiritual peace, in follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Duties; but on the contrary, hath much an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xiety and perplexity, through fear, leaſt he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain not, or miſs his ſelfie end; he is perplexed and vexed with the thoughts of ſuch and ſuch events, which may follow upon what he does, toſſed, in a manner tormented in himſelf, with thinking what if this, that, and the other thing follow upon what I do? whereas the man that walks ſingly in the diſcharge of his Duty, remains ſetled, compoſed, and much freed from theſe perplexing fears of events; as we may ſee in <hi>Paul, Acts.</hi> 2.13. Who, when it was told him, that he ſhould be bound at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and he

A 4th. Evidence Is, That a man who walks by a principle of Self, and ſeeks himſelf only, or mainly, in what he doth, is up or down, as he finds or miſſes himſelf; if his duty go with him, though he have no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs to God in it, he will be well ſatisfied; as for inſtance, if he Pray well, in the opinion of others, and win at the following of other Duties, ſo as to be eſteemed of, as a wiſe virgin, that not only hes a Lamp, but oyl in it, he is content, and that even though he have not Oyl in his Lamp; But where ſingleneſs is, a man is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſatisfied in the performance of Duties, though he get applauſe, and eſteem from others, unleſs he obtain <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The 3d. <hi>Uſe</hi> ſerves for warning, ſeing there is ſuch a Corruption, that cleaves to Chriſts fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, and that deceitfully and ſubtilly bears in it ſelf upon them in all that they do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> then 1. Labour to diſcern it, and to be watchful over it. 2ly. Labour carefully to guard againſt it. <hi>First,</hi> I ſay, labour to diſcern, and to be watchful over this Corruption; and more eſpecially, when it works moſt deceitfully, and ſubtilly, and inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ats it ſelf under ſpecious and fair pretenſions, when it looks like Grace, or a principle of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, when it ſhreuds it ſelf under the pretext of ſome honeſt deſign, or of ſome moral, or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural good: O! do not judge of things as they appear at the firſt; but ſearch to the bottom of them, and conſider well whence they riſe, and whither they tend: There are ſome things that look very fair and ſpecious like at this time, which, if we examine them narrowly, will we apprehend, be found to ſpring from this bitter, and corrupt Root; the men that have invaded us, and overturned theſe Kingdoms, give it out, that they are for great and good things; But look well that there be not much Self-ſeeking, lurking, and lodging under ſuch ſpecious, fair and plauſable pretenſions; There are <hi>four</hi> things highly pretended to by them (ſome of which we touched a little before) 1. They talk much of, and pretend the intereſt of Chriſt, and that they ſeek to have him great, and his Kingdom to flooriſh in theſe Lands; and indeed, none
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:135228:37"/> can deny theſe to be very good, and deſirable things; but yet notwithſtanding, when his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt is ſought, and followed in a carnal way, and when m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n ſeek their own intereſt, cry up themſelves, and endeavour to make themſelves great, under this ſpecious pretext of reſpect to Chriſts intereſt, and to the making of him great, This certainly is not good: what greater ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour could we readily have wiſhed to be put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Chriſt, then ſeeking <hi>to make him a King,</hi> as the People of the <hi>Jewes</hi> ſpoken of, <hi>John</hi> 6.15. did; and yet behold what he ſays to them, <hi>verſe</hi> 26. <hi>Ye ſeek me, not becauſe you ſaw the miracles, but becauſe ye did eat of the loaves, and were filled;</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timating thereby, that it was reſpect to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and to an eaſie way of living, that main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ut reſpect on him, and court him to be their King; but they quite miſtook the true nature of Chriſts Kingdom: and therefore, when the reſpect that men profeſs to have to Chriſt, is ſuch as alters the nature of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and turns that which is a Spiritual King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom into a Carnal, and Worldly one, we would be aware of it. 2ly. The intereſt of the people of God, and of Chriſts Followers, is much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, and cryed up; and indeed that alſo is a good and deſirable thing; But as Chriſts King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is not Temporal and Worldly, no more is the great intereſt of his People; This was it, that <hi>Korah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram</hi> pretended to be for, while they were in the meantime crying down all Government, Civil and Eccleſiaſtical, for they ſay unto <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron, Numb.</hi> 16.3. <hi>Ye take too much upon you, ſeing all the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are holy, every one of them, and the Lord is

There are great pretenſions made to, and cryings up of juſt Liberty and Freedom, which is likewiſe a good and deſirable thing, as it's very ſad, when men are deprived of it; yet a great deal of Selfineſs may hide it ſelf under ſuch pretenſions; Conſider what the Apoſtle ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to this purpoſe. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.16. <hi>As free, and not uſing your liberty for a cloke of maliciouſneſs, but as the ſervants of God;</hi> The Sco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The <hi>Firſt</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is, That ye would learn to ſet Chriſt in his own place, in the heart; for, if he have not his own place and room there, Self muſt needs bear ſwey in us: but when Chriſt gets his own place Selfineſs is thereby keeped out; therefore 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4 <hi>v.</hi> 5. <hi>Paul</hi> proves, that he <hi>preached not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> becauſe <hi>he preached Chriſt Jeſus the Lord;</hi> whoever they be, that labour not to ſet up Chriſt in their hearts, and to eſteem highly of, and to be much in Love with him above all things; will have a worſe Gueſt comîng in to take up his room; and indeed, it is not much to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered at, that Self reign, and prevail amongſt People, and that they be mainly, or very much ſweyed by it, in the whole of their way, when Chriſt is either not at all, or but very little in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count and eſteem with them. 2ly. Labour to eye God always, to have a conſtant depending on him, to have his awe and dread much upon your hearts, and to be much with him; O! ſtudy to live up unto that ſweet advice which <hi>Solomon</hi> gives, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3 <hi>v.</hi> 6. <hi>Truſt in the Lord with all thine heart, and lean not to thine own under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding;</hi> and if it ſhould be ſaid, what ſhal we do, if we lean not to our own underſtanding? he anſwers, <hi>In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he ſhall direct thy paths;</hi> do as the Pſalmiſt did, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.6, <hi>even ſet the Lord always be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you,</hi> and then <hi>he being at your right hand, ye ſhall not be moved.</hi> 3ly. Be much in prayer to God, as the Apoſtle was, when <hi>a meſsenger of Satan was ſent to buffet him.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12 8. <hi>for this thing</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>I beſought the Lord thrice that it might depart from me;</hi> So do ye, wreſtle

                  </gap> manifeſted for this purpoſe, that he might deſtroy the works of the devil,</hi> and this work of his this Corruption of Self amongſt others; little praying, and little uſe making of Chriſt in pray<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>er, makes Self predomine, and bear ſo much ſwey in us, as it doth. 4ly. We would be more frequently looking to our own infirmities, that either to the good that is in our ſelves, or to the infirmities of others: Thus we find <hi>Paul</hi> dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the thoughts of his own inſufficiency, weakneſs, and infirmitie, while he ſays, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Not that we are ſufficient of our ſelves, to think any thing, as of our ſelves, but our ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency is of God;</hi> he alwayes puts a difference between what he was by Grace, and what he was in himſelf, and looks upon himſelf as himſelf, as being able for nothing: looking too much upon the good we have, or ſeem to have, and too much upon the infirmities of others, makes us proud, and puffs us up, but looking to our own infirmities, more than to our own good, or the infirmities of others, keeps down the riſings of Pride, and looks Self out of countenance, and lets us ſee that there is much in our ſelves to humble us, and nothing at all to be vain, or proud of, and that we want a great deal more than we have. 5ly. See that ye father right (to ſpeak ſo) any good that ye have, as the Apoſtle fathers all upon, and aſcribes all his good to the free Grace of God, while he ſayes, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.10. <hi>But by the grace of God, I am what I am, and his grace which was beſtowed upon me, was
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:135228:40"/> not in vain, but I laboured more aboundantly than they all, yet not I, but the grace of God, with me;</hi> We find it alſo much preſſed upon us, that we would remember, <hi>that we have nothing, but what we have received;</hi> The due and kindly remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, and conſideration whereof, would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent our growing proud conceited, and vain of what we have. 6ly. Reſiſt the firſt beginnings, and riſings of Selfineſs in the heart; and as <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> exhorts, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.23. <hi>Keep thy heart with all diligence, for out of it are the iſſues of life;</hi> if once we give looſe reigns within to this, or to any other Corruption, it will ſhortly prevail over us, and break out; as for inſtance, let men once greedily receive, and admit of honour, when it is given them, and they will greatly aſtect, and ſeek after it, er'e all be done; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what our Lord ſayes to this purpoſe, <hi>John</hi> 5.44. <hi>How can ye believe, that receive honour one of another, and ſeek not the honour that cometh from God only?</hi> When men are Selfie, in ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be high and happy in the World, and do not place their honour and happineſs where God hath placed it, they muſt needs be carried away with this Corruption of Selfineſs: believe it, they cannot be Chriſts Diſciples, who ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avour, not through Grace to ſuppreſs the riſings of this Corruption in themſelves, and to reſiſt tentations to it; as ye may ſee <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> did, by comparing <hi>Luke</hi> 13 <hi>v.</hi> 15.16. with <hi>John</hi> 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

All that would guard againſt this evil of ſelfineſs, and carry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right in Du<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>y, would be much in Self-reflection before the undertaking of Duties; in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of Duties, and after the performance of Duties; it's lamentable, that moſt of us never reflect upon, nor conſider, from what principle, or motive we are put on to Duty, but if the work be good, for the matter we look after no more; and that many never reflect upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, in the diſcharge of Duty, that they may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>We took up this great obſtruction in theſe <hi>three</hi> Branches; The firſt whereof is, That there is ſuch a Corruption even in Believers; as to be much affected, ſwayed, and influenced in what they do, by a Selfie principle; to be off, or on at Dutie, according as ſomewhat of Self is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, or not, to be more ſwayed by that than by the Duties that are called for from them, or by the right end thereof, or by the Rule which is given them to follow. The 2d. Branch is, That this Corruption of Selfineſs does often wind, ſteal, and inſinuat it Self in upon the moſt Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Duties of the moſt Spiritual and Holy Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers

               </gap>ing a moſt unſeaſonable, and prejudicial over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to his Maſter, to become an offence to him, though he that was like us in all things except Sin, was a brazen wall againſt the Tentation, ſo that it could not poſſibly take upon him; yet it ſays this much, that this ſubtill Corruption may ſteal in on the beſt of Chriſtians, ſince it did ſo on <hi>Peter,</hi> and that immediatly after his giving of a moſt ſolemn and celebrious confeſſion of his Faith in Chriſt, and of him; of theſe two Branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, we have already ſpoken.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Third</hi> follows now to be ſpoken of, which is, That wherever this Corrupt Self bears ſway and dominiers in men, it utterly marrs, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructs them in following of Chriſt; It is that which lets and impeds their Sanctification, and Obedience in Duties called for from them, in their following Jeſus Chriſt; or ye may take it thus; This Selfie Corruption, or corrupt Selfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, whereby men do prefer, and oppoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to God, and his will, and to the concerns of Jeſus Chriſt, hinders, and obſtructs, and (as it were) myres them in their following of Chriſt ſo that they never win up to it, while this cleaves
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:135228:45"/> and ſticks to them unmortified; therefore when ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Lord was giving Directions to his Diſciples, how they may win to follow him; he firſt (as I ſaid propoſeth this as the great impediment, that muſt be taken out of the way, elſe they canno<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> come after him, nor are meet to follow him; This is ſo very clear, in the whole current of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Scripture, that when it ſpeaks of this <hi>Self,</hi> an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of Chriſt, the one of them is oppoſed to the other, as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.15. <hi>To live to our ſelf, and to live to Chriſt,</hi> are oppoſed as inconſiſtent; ſo <hi>Philip.</hi> 2.21. It's ſaid, that <hi>all men ſeek their own things, and not the things that are Jeſus Chriſts;</hi> Where ſeeking of our own things, and the things of Chriſt are oppoſed, as incompatible; and <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.18. <hi>Serving of mens ſelves, and their own bellies,</hi> is oppoſed unto, as utterly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with <hi>ſerving Chriſt; they that are ſuch</hi> (ſayeth the <hi>Apoſtle) ſerve not the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, but their own bellies:</hi> I ſhall further clear and confirm this truth in <hi>Three</hi> general inſtances, 1. Let us look to the way that Chriſt calls to walk in, and let a man adviſe with fleſh and blood, and follow the counſel that corrupt Self gives; and it will be found to ſpeak quite ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing than what is the mind of Chriſt; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.16. That in following of Chriſts call, <hi>he conſulted not with fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſh and blood;</hi> Intimating this much, that if he had conſulted with fleſh and blood, it had been long ere he had obeyed his call, if at all; fleſh and blood has quite another language, as Chriſt ſays to <hi>Peter</hi> in the <hi>verſe</hi> preceeding the Text, <hi>Thou ſavoureſt not the things that be of God, but the things that be of men.</hi> The breath of fleſh
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:135228:45"/> has (to ſpeak ſo) another ſmell, another ſcope and end than the breathing of the Spirit of Chriſt hath. 2ly. If we look to the matter of Faith in Chriſt, we will find it very clear, for fleſh and blood, or this Corruption of Selfineſs, is the great obſtruction that keeps men from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving; what, I pray, kept the <hi>Jewes,</hi> and what keeps all others, while in their natural ſtate, from ſubmitting to the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt? even this, <hi>That being ignorant of Gods righteouſneſs, they go about to eſtabliſh their own righteouſneſs, and ſo ſubmit not themſelves unto the righteouſneſs of God;</hi> It's mens natural ſelf-eſteem, the good opinion, and conceit of their own righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, which they cannot find in their heart to quite and forgo, but ſtick tenaciouſly by it, and glory in it, as that which will not miſs to juſtifie them before God, and procure his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance; This, this is the great Rock of Offence whereon the <hi>Jews</hi> ſtumbled long ago, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on multitudes in the viſible Church, do at this day ſtumble, and break their necks, and come never up to a ſincere cloſure by Faith, with the righteouſneſs of Chriſt. 3ly. It will yet be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther clear, if we look on ſuffering for Chriſt and for the Truth, which is the more immediat ſcope aimed at by our Lord here; There is a very plauſible, proper and pertinent-like tent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tion that comes in the way of ſuffering, <hi>Master, be it far from thee, this ſhall not be unto thee, pity and ſpare thy ſelf,</hi> and in ſparing thy ſelf, ſpare us; There is ſuch a prevalent inordinat love to ones Self, that as Satan ſaid of <hi>Job,</hi> in a calumniating way, <hi>Skin for skin, &amp; all that a man hath will be give for his life;</hi> So we may ſay, what will not a
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:135228:46"/> man give, do and adventure on to ſpare and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve this ſelf? nothing is ſo precious and dear to the man, as that wherein Self is concerned; which was that which the falſe Apoſtles ſo much valued and ſought after, (as <hi>Paul</hi> ſhews, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.1, 2.) and from immoderat love to it declin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſuffering; and is it not obviouſly to be ſeen, in our ordinary practice? we love not to ſail againſt croſſe winds, to be Religious, when they that depart from iniquity, make themſelves a prey; and to hold faſt Chriſts name, and not to deny his Faith, where Satan dwells, and hath a throne, and where ſuch as <hi>Antipas</hi> Chriſts faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Martyrs, are put to death, we have no like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of.</p>
            <p>For yet furder clearing of this matter, I ſhal ſpeak a little to theſe <hi>two</hi> things. 1. To the corrupting influence that Selfineſs has on Duty. 2ly. To the reaſon of it.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>firſt,</hi> The corrupting influence that ſelfineſs has on Duty; let us try Dutie from the very riſe, to the cloſe of it, in our following of Chriſt, and we will find that it hath ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence on it all along, whether we conſider Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in reference to our ſelves that perform it, or in reference to God, to whom it is perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: <hi>firſt,</hi> Conſider Duty, in reference to the performer of it, and behold the corrupting influence of Self. 1. In diſcerning Dutie, Selfie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs will readily ſhut out light, and ſhuffle by many things to get ſome pretext for walking con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to what light points out as Duty, if it ſhould even go with <hi>Balaam,</hi> to ſeek after new light, not holding with the clear light that it hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready gotten; and if it dar not go directly againſt
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:135228:46"/> that light, yet it will un-necſſarily adventure on re-examination of it, ſecretly wiſhing, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eeking after another light; In this caſe, it's juſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ay be ſo with others, leſs or more. 2ly. Look <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o it in mens following of Duty, and there it will be found ſo to obſtruct and langle them, as it were, that they cannot run the way of Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, till <hi>the loins of the mind,</hi> the affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and this eſpecially be <hi>girded up,</hi> as the Apoſtle exhorts, 1 <hi>Pet</hi> 1.13. 3ly. This Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption hath ſuch influence, that it will much blaſt a perſon in Duty, I mean, it will not only unfit, &amp; indiſpoſe him for it, but it will make him dry and dead, in the performance of it; as the Apoſtle inſinuats it to have been with thoſe falſe Teachers, who preached themſelves, they had <hi>Words</hi> but wanted the <hi>Power.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.19, 20. And as it may be thus in Preaching, ſo it may be in Prayer, and other Duties of Worſhip; in Chriſtians converſing together for mutual edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, it will readily make their diſcourſe fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and little profitable, and turn all, as it were, into empty ſound. In the <hi>Second</hi> Place, as it blaſts and corrupts Duties by it's influence theſe ways, in reference to the performer of them; ſo in reference to God, to whom they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed ſeveral ways; As 1. it makes the moſt precious Duties in themſelves to be accounted but as ſins before God, ſo <hi>Zach.</hi> 7.5. The Lord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeaks
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:135228:47"/> his profeſt People thus, <hi>When ye faſted and mourned, did ye at all faſt to me?</hi> Thus it was with the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> their publick and long prayers, which were gone about <hi>to be ſeen of men,</hi> and to compaſs ſome one or other ſelfie deſign; that which they looked on as acceptable Duty, the Lord accounts the very ground of a challenge; and indeed it's both a juſt and great ground of challenge, when corrupt Self gets Gods room and place. 2ly. As it changeth, in a manner, the very nature of the Duty, ſo in ſome reſpect, it deſtroys and annihilats it; Thus <hi>Ephraim</hi> is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted to be an <hi>empty vine</hi> without fruit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>he bringeth forth fruit to himſelf.</hi> 3ly. It de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prives the man of Gods gracious reward; as the giving of a little aims, if it were but <hi>a cup of cold water, in the name of a diſciple loſeth not it's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward;</hi> ſo when much more is given from a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and ſelfie principle, as <hi>to be ſeen of men,</hi> it hath no reward; yea, when men come, as it were, to the very top of Duty, if it be performed on this account, it hath no reward following, but ſuch as they will ruſe themſelves little of, verily (ſayeth the Lord) <hi>they have their reward;</hi> and to this purpoſe ſayes the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.17. <hi>If I do this thing willingly, I have a reward,</hi> that is, if I go about my Duty of Preaching the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel ſincerely, I may humbly and confidently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the reward; but if otherwiſe, I cannot: what ſhall I ſay more of the wofull influence of this corrupt Self? It is a great breaker of the peace; it's a mighty obſtructer of inward peace and joy; <hi>This is our rejoycing</hi> (ſayeth the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12.) <hi>the teſtimony of our conſcience that in ſimplicity, and godly ſincerity, we have
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:135228:47"/> had our converſation in the world;</hi> inſinuating plainly thereby, that if he had been without this ſincerity, and had made himſelf his end, he could not have had either joy or peace; This may ſerve to confirm this part of the Doctrine.</p>
            <p>We come now to the 2d thing propoſed for clearing of this Point, to wit, The <hi>Reaſons</hi> why, or how it comes to paſs, that ſelfineſs hath ſuch a corrupting hand in, and influence upon mens Duties, yea, often in a great meaſure, even up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Duties of Believers. 1. It proceeds from the nature of this Corruption, which is ſuch that it hath more univerſal influence than other Corruptions, it runs thorow all Duties, and more or leſs ſpoils them, it hath a hand (to ſay ſo) in every ill turn; other Corruptions run, ſome in this, and ſome in that channel, but this runs (as it were) in every channel, it's the great Idol, to which all the demi-gods of leſſer idols bow, and ſubmit themſelves; it, as it were, ſway<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it's Scepter over them all; Thus when the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> is drawing (as it were) a cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of evils. <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. he ſayes, <hi>whence come warrs and fightings amongſt you? art they not from your luſts, that warr in your members?</hi> It is always ſome one ſelfie end and concern or another, that brings men in tops with the Rule of Dutie: If we look to ſchiſms, diviſions and offences, they will be found to come from this bitter root, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.17, 18. <hi>Mark them that cauſe diviſions</hi> (ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Apoſtle) <hi>for they ſerve not our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, but their own bellies, and by good words and fair ſpeeches, deceive the hearts of the ſimple;</hi> Thus it might be inſtanced in moſt, if not in all the particular miſcarriages of men. 2ly. It pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:135228:48"/> from the ſingularly great oppoſition of this Corruption to Grace, and the utter inconſiſtency of the one of them with the other, where this Self reigns, it's a non-ſuch enemy, to the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt; other Corruptions are but as Branches of this, and make ſudden excurſions by more tranſient acts, but this lyeth cloſs (as it were) in ambuſh continually, it lyeth at the root, for it contends with Chriſt for the Throne and prerogatives of his Crown; It's therefore more directly oppoſit to him, and inconſiſtent with his honour than other Corruptions, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 5. 3ly. It's of a very corrupting influence, becauſe of the pleaſant flattering nature of it; there is ſo great ſibneſs and affinity betwixt men and this Corruption, that it's therefore called Self; It has a kind of Dominion and Law over men, that they think they cannot with reaſon, nor without prejudice to themſelves, refuſe to comply with it's dictats; as is clear in that ſad inſtance of our firſt Parents, <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> the Aple is holden out by it, <hi>as pleaſant to the eye, and good for food, and to make one wiſe, to know good and evil;</hi> The Selfie tentation ſayes, it is ſo very deſirable, and ſo good a thing, that it were unreaſonable to refuſe to eat of it, there is ſuch a ſeeming ſuitableneſs and congruity betwixt men and Self, that there is no reſiſting of it except powerful Grace come in for inabling to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand and reſiſt it; it has ſuch a dominion, that all men out of Chriſt are living to themſelves, This is their great ſcope, and end in all that they do, an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The <hi>Firſt Uſe</hi> of this ſerves for warning, That ſince this is ſo very fruitful a Corruption by it's great influence, and ſince it's ſo prevailing a Corruption, ſo often, and ſo much, that the greateſt falls and miſcarriages of, even Believers, may be drawn from this, as the ſpecial Spring and Fountain of them; we had therefore ſo much the more need to watch againſt it, that it wynd not it ſelf ſo far in upon us, as to bear ſway; for if it prevail, there will be little right in Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; there will be little peace and tranquillity in the mind and Conſcience; and little thriving in any thing that is good; if it be dark here, how great will the darkneſs be? We would there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by all means caſt it out, that it ſteal not in to marr not only peace and comfort, but even Light it ſelf: <hi>Firſt,</hi> then when ye are conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what to do in difficult Caſes and Emergents, take heed and be aware of liſtning to Selfie argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, pleading for, and pretending pity to Self. 2ly. Beware of it when it comes to the Duty, that when it prevails, not to diſwade from the Duty, it go not along with you in it; there is need of watchfulneſs and ſingleneſs in the one, as well as in the other. 3ly. Beware of it when ye have done the Duty; for we may have ſome ſucceſs in Duty, and yet by Selfineſs and Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickling-reflections on it, when done, we may caſt all down, and get our reward: In a more ſpecial manner, we would be aware of, and guard againſt Selfineſs in theſe caſes. 1. When the Tentation to it is moſt lively, and is readieſt, and liklieſt to prevail and bear ſway: ſometimes there will be fewer motives and incentives to this Corruption, and then the hazard is not ſo great;

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Caſe is, When the Tentation ſuits our particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar humour and inclination, or when that to which we are tempted, agrees well with our more particular affections; it is no great matter for ſome to ſtand out againſt profeſt maligne oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to Godlineſſe, nor for others to ſtand it out againſt Sectarian Errors, becauſe their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination and affection ſwayes them ſo to do; but to ſtand it out againſt both, is another matter, and <hi>to keep our ſelves from our iniquity,</hi> (as <hi>David</hi> profeſſeth he did, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.23. Is a great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and a ſpecial practique; It's nothing to ſtand out againſt that which (to ſpeak ſo) is another mans tentation; but it's much to ſtand it out againſt a mans own proper tentation; As for inſtance, hundreths have gone over to the ſide of maligne oppoſers of Godlineſs, theſe years paſt, becauſe their inclination ſwayed them to ſide with that ſort of men; but they have need now to be upon their guard, that have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved from the former evil, that they go not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to the way of Sectaries, eſpecially ſuch whoſe inclination doth any way diſpoſe them, to like of that way. A 3d. Caſe is this, When all things
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:135228:49"/> go well with perſons, and they are fair before the wind, ſitting quiet in much outward peace and caſe, as it was with <hi>David;</hi> who is then ſooner prevailed with by tentations, as proudly to number the people, and to give way to his luſt, and for hideing of that, to be acceſſory to the killing by the Sword of the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and valiant <hi>Uriah,</hi> (all proceeding from pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailling <hi>Self</hi>) Than when he was wandering up and down the hills and mountains, and had no place to hide his head in; It's harder in a time of caſe than in a time of trouble and hard exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, to reſiſt any Tentation, and a Tentation to Selfineſs in particular: yea, this will hold e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in reſpect of Chriſtians ſpiritual condition, when it is good, and when manifeſtations of God ſome way abound with them, as they did in a great and extraordinary meaſure and manner with holy <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. They are then in emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent hazard to be puffed up; and after being in ſuch a condition by not watching againſt this <hi>Self,</hi> have got ſorer and more dangerous wounds, than when their bands have been ſtraiter. A 4th Caſe is, When the Tentation to Selfineſs is near, and offers us a fit reaſon, and opportunity for gratifying of <hi>Self,</hi> for ſometime the Tentation to Selfineſs will ſeem to be far away, and may be ſo comparatively, and then the hazard is not ſo great, as when it comes very near, and cloſe up to us, we would at leaſt then ſtoutly reſiſt it; Thus, <hi>Act.</hi> 14. When the People of <hi>Lyſtra</hi> came to offer Sacrifice to the Apoſtles, as if they had been gods, tempting them at a high rate to Selfineſs, how <hi>was their ſpirit ſtirred?</hi> And how did they ſhew their diſlike of, and indignation
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:135228:50"/> at it, by <hi>renting of their cloths?</hi> So when all the People were in expectation of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and were wondering what a man <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> might be, <hi>John Chap.</hi> 1. Then, in that very nick of time, did <hi>he confeſs and not deny, but confeſsed, that he was not the Chriſt;</hi> and ſo reſolutly reſiſted the Tentation to Self-ſeeking: I ſay, in the caſe of particular, and preſent Tentations, men are in much greater hazard to be prevailed over by this corrupt Self, than when Tentations to it are at a greater diſtance as <hi>Herod,</hi> when the people cryed out, at his Oration to them, <hi>the voice of God, and not of man,</hi> he is ſo taken and tickled, with this ſacrilegious and blaſphemous applauſe, and ſo puft up with proud Self, that the true and jealous God falls on him inſtantly, ſtricks him dead, by contemptible worms; Tentation at a diſtance may more eaſily be reſiſted, but not ſo eaſily when it comes near, and, as it were, whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers a man in the ear, (as <hi>Peter</hi> did our Lord) then it would be inte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Before any further proceeding, let me ſpeak a few words in application to this time; there are in our preſent Tentations, ſomethings viſible
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:135228:50"/> and palpable, that call aloud on us, not to come near, but to keep at due diſtance; as if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider in the <hi>firſt</hi> place, the principle that act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth thoſe men who have brought theſe Lands under ſubjection to them, and would now have us making our ſelves acceſſory to the ſame guilt with them; it were good that we took notice of the Apoſtles words, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.18. <hi>Theſe men ſerve not our Lord Jeſus Christ, but their own bellies, and by fair words, and good ſpeeches, deceive the hearts of the ſimple;</hi> a Tentation may come to us under very good words, and fair ſpeeches, and yet if we look well to the deſign, and drift of it, we will find it to be <hi>Selfie;</hi> the principle ſo much talked of, and magnified is called <hi>Self-preſervation,</hi> but it may more fitly be called, <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving of themſelves,</hi> in their power and greatneſs. 2ly. If we conſider the means that they make uſe of, and the ways and methods which they follow, we will find that the proſpect is, to be great, to be the head, and not the tail, and to be ſole Maſters; and indeed it were a wronging of our light to deny, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>elfineſs is prevalent here; That it is this which puts them to take ſuch and ſuch meaſures, and not others, and to give ſuch and ſuch orders is too, too p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

If we look to the great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, that pouſſeth on the Tentation, we will find it to be Selfineſs; on the one ſide, there is utter ruine and undoing, and this hath great weight with Self; on the other ſide, there is great gain and advantage, much peace, eaſe and freedom from trouble, and theſe are very take<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Self; I grant theſe things conſidered ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractly,

            <p>But it may be <hi>Asked</hi> here, how can this Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation be known, when any thing offers it ſelf
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:135228:51"/> to us, under a fair and ſpecious pretext, and yet is nothing elſe but Self? For <hi>Anſwer,</hi> I ſay, it may be known, and I ſhal from <hi>Peters</hi> way here, give ſome few marks, whereby it may be known; <hi>Firſt,</hi> then it walketh, and is more ſwayed by events, than divine Rules of Duty; therefore, when our Lord is called in duty, to go to <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> and gives an account of what is to befall him there, <hi>Peter</hi> ſayes, <hi>Far be it from thee, Lord, this ſhall not be unto thee;</hi> Whereas Singleneſs looks by, and over events to Duty, as it did in <hi>Paul, Act.</hi> 21. who would needs go to <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> notwithſtanding all the moſt importunat, mournful and heart-breaking diſſwaſions of his Chriſtian Friends, from going thither, becauſe of what <hi>Agabus</hi> foretold he was to meet with, declaring himſelf <hi>ready, not only to be bound but to die there for the name of the Lord Jeſus;</hi> I will not ſay, but the conſideration of Events may have it's own weight in mens conſultations, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially about their temporal affairs, but it's dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, and unſafe to take them for grounds of clearing the Conſcience about Duty. 2ly. This Tentation to Selfineſs doth ordinarly lay more weight upon what deals with, and moves the Affections, than on what clears and convinceth the Judgement and Conſcience, by ſound rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; If thou do this or that, it will be waited with ſuch and ſuch hazard and prejudice, and if thou wilt forbear, thou ſhalt have ſuch and ſuch advantage by the forbearance; <hi>Peter</hi> is much here in pathetick diſswading, but offers no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; ſo it's ſaid of theſe falſe Teachers, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. <hi>v.</hi> 18. That <hi>they deceived with good words, and fair ſpeeches,</hi> There was more plauſible inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:135228:52"/> on the affections, than any ſtrength of ſolid reaſon, and argument. 3ly. This Tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion loves better to round in the ear, and in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, than to ſhew it ſelf in the light, and more publickly; Thus <hi>Peter</hi> here <hi>takes our Lord aſide,</hi> and rounds his advice in his ear, being unwilling to bring it under publick conſideration, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſſing, (forgetting that he had dealt with one who was not capable of being taken in the leaſt, with the moſt ſecret ſubtile and plauſible Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation:) Hence oftentimes men will not only bring over themſelves, but others alſo to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with a Tentation, by that which they dar not bring forth to the Light, and to open view; motives working on the affections, may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times do in ſecret, but when a thing comes to light, and above board, then there muſt be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons brought forth, which being wanting, this Tentation deals by motives, (as I ſaid) in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret; There are but few cogent reaſons brought to induce us to acknowledge theſe men that will rule over us, but many motives: if we do it not, this &amp; that, and the other piece of ſuffering will follow upon our refuſing, and is it not beſt, we be all one? and the like, no ſatisfying evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence given that the thing is night. 4ly.

            <p>YE may Remember, we drew theſe Words to <hi>Four</hi> Heads. 1. The great and main deſign, that ſuch as would ingadge with Chriſt ſhould have before them; even <hi>to come after Chriſt, and follow him.</hi> 2ly. The great obſtruction that lyeth in the way of men, coming after, and following of Chriſt, and that is <hi>Selfineſs,</hi> or inordinat regard to a mans Self; which makes him fall ſhort in that Reſpect and
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:135228:57"/> Duty which he owes to Chriſt. 3ly. The Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that is required in, or the Duty that lyes upon the man that will come after, and follow Chriſt in three ſteps; every one of which quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies (to ſay ſo) another. 1. <hi>He must deny him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</hi> 2ly. <hi>Take up his croſs.</hi> 3ly. <hi>Follow Chriſt.</hi> 4ly The neceſſity of this, <hi>Let him do it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of the <hi>Firſt two,</hi> we have ſpoken already, and come therefore now to ſpeak a word to the <hi>third, viz.</hi> The Qualification required in, or the Duty that lyes upon a follower of Chriſt, in theſe <hi>three</hi> ſteps propoſed; The <hi>firſt</hi> whereof is <hi>Self-denyal;</hi> whence we <hi>Obſerve</hi> (the Words clearly give us the Doctrine) <hi>That is is requiſit in all that would follow Christ, and give up their names to him to be his Diſciples, that their chief work be to deny themſelves;</hi> This is the firſt thing that he requires here, and the firſt ſtep of the way, without which none can follow him, nor make any progreſs in their way of following him; for clearneſs cauſe, ye may take the <hi>Doctrine</hi> in theſe <hi>three</hi> Branches, or look upon it theſe <hi>three</hi> ways. 1. As it holds out Chriſts calling unto this, and his laying it on his followers, as a Duty, to <hi>deny themſelves.</hi> 2ly. As it is a requiſit qualification, fitting them for following of him; ſhewing, that Self-denyal is that which notably qualifies a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be a follower of Chriſt. 3ly. As it holds forth a neceſſity of the Duty, that a man muſt needs by any means deny himſelf, that would come after, and follow Chriſt; all the <hi>three</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to, and reſolve in this, even the commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this Grace of <hi>Self denyal,</hi> and in preſſi g the neceſſity of it; and therefore I ſhall ſpeak of them complexly together. 1. By ſhowing what
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:135228:58"/> 
               <hi>Self-denyal</hi> is, 2ly. By clearing thoſe <hi>three</hi> fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Branches. 3ly. By making uſe of them; and all this will be the eaſier, and we may be the ſhorter in it, that we have ſpoken of the contrary corruption of <hi>Selfineſs</hi> ſomewhat largely before.</p>
            <p>For clearing then of the <hi>Firſt</hi> of theſe, to wit, What is meant by <hi>Self-denyal;</hi> Conſider <hi>Firſt,</hi> what is meant by Selfineſs, which is nothing elſe than a mans exceſſive, and inordinat regard to himſelf, and being too much ſwayed with Selfie-reſpect; and therefore to deny our ſelves, is to be abſtracted from all inordinat Selfie-reſpects, and conſiderations, in the following of Chriſt, as if we had not a Self (to ſpeak ſo) as if we had no reaſon, wit, will, nor parts of our own; ſo to be denyed to theſe, as if we had them not at all, or as they were not ours, or in us. 2ly. Conſider how this word is uſed. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Having a form of Godlineſs, but denying the power thereof;</hi> That is, though they make profeſſion of Godlineſs, yet they no more care for the power of it, than if there were not ſuch a thing; they have no regard in their life to God, but what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever be their profeſſion of him in word, <hi>yet in their works they deny him,</hi> as it is, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.16. So that a man who is denyed to himſelf aright lives in reſpect of any inordinat eſtimation of, love to, delight in, and care for himſelf, and endeavours to walk as ſingly, in reſpect of theſe, as if no ſuch affections, or paſſions were at all in him. 3ly. Conſider, and compare ſome Scripture-phraſes, and examples, and they will help to clear what <hi>Self-denyal</hi> is, as 1. That Phraſe which we have, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.24. in the example of <hi>Moſes, By faith,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:135228:58"/> Moſes refuſed to be called the ſon of Pharaohs daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and chooſed rather to ſuffer affliction with the people of God;</hi> It is the ſame word in the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal that is uſed here, <hi>He denyed to be called the Son of Pharaohs daughter;</hi> he had ſo little undue reſpect to his own eaſe, pleaſure, profite, and preferment, that when the Tentation to theſe comes in his way, he walks as ſingly and ſelf-denyedly, as if he had met with no ſuch thing; when that Tentation aſſaulted him, he reſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refuſed, and denyed to admit of it. A 2d Phraſe we have in <hi>Pauls</hi> example, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.14. <hi>God forbid,</hi> (ſayeth the Apoſtle) <hi>that I ſhould rejoyce ſave in the croſs of Chriſt, whereby the world is crucified to me, and I unto the world;</hi> Oppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therein his own ſingle way, to the Selfie way of theſe falſe teachers, who preached circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to eſchew the Croſs, and ſhews what it was to be denyed in that way, <hi>Even to be crucified to the world, and to have the world crucified to him?</hi> So that the world had no more power to tempt him, than a dead man hanging on a Croſs would have had. A 3d. Phraſe we have, in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Levi, Deut.</hi> 33.9. <hi>Who ſaid unto his father and mother, I have not ſeen him, neither did he acknowledge his brethren, nor knew his own children;</hi> In executing Juſtice, at Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, he did it as impartially, and Self-denyed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as if he had never ſeen Father nor Mother, Brethren nor Children, or as if he had been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der no obligation, or tye of reſpect, by vertue of ſuch near and dear Relations The 4th and laſt Phraſe, we have in the perſon &amp; example of <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 131. <hi>v.</hi> 2. <hi>I have</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>behaved and quitted my ſelf as a child that is weaned of his
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:135228:59"/> Mother, my ſoul is even as a weaned child;</hi> Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting, That he had no ſort of allowed inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat purpoſe, project, or deſign in the world for himſelf, no more, in a manner, than a Child, but juſt now weaned from his Mother hath any project at all; but was ready to take off Gods hand, whatever he was pleaſed to diſpenſe, and carve out to him; and that he was not ſwayed by any particular allowed inordinat reſpect to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or by any finiſtruous ſelfie deſign, but wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> lying before the Lord, ready to receive, and take on any impreſſion, that he ſhould pleaſe to put on him. If now we lay theſe <hi>three</hi> together, we will in a good meaſure ſee, and underſtand, what <hi>Self-denyal,</hi> or a <hi>Self-denyed</hi> Perſon is, and what is called for from a man that would deny him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in following of Chriſt; it's even to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to be as ſingle, as if he had not a Self, and that he be denyed to all inordinat reſpects to, and conſiderations, dead in a manner, to all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due Self-love, Self-pleaſure, Self-advantage, Self-eſtimation, Self-deſign, Self-confidence, and the like.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Second</hi> place, for clearing it in theſe <hi>three</hi> Branches which we propoſed. 1. We find <hi>Self-denyal</hi> called for as a Duty, as a fruit of new Obedience, and as a tye and obligation that lyes upon Chriſtians, by vertue of Chriſts purchaſe; So 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.15. Where living to our ſelves, and living to Chriſt are oppoſed; and not living to our ſelves, implyes a denying of our ſelves; and ſayes the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.19, 20. <hi>Ye are not your own, ye are bought with a price;</hi> Therefore let it not be your work to live to your ſelves, but <hi>to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie God in your bodies and in your ſpirits, which

            <p>And ſo we come to the 3d <hi>Branch</hi> propoſed, <hi>viz.</hi> The abſolute neceſſity of this Grace or Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which will appear, if we conſider theſe things. 1. The nature of Selfineſs, and of Chriſts way, and how inconſiſtent the one is with the other, Selfineſs, or living to our ſelves, and liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Chriſt, being, (as we ſhew) always op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed one to another in the Scripture; Therefore a man muſt either deny himſelf, or deny living to Chriſt; when a man follows the counſel of Self; he rejects Chriſts counſel; where Self is taken in, Chriſt is keeped at the door; and where Self is ſet up, Chriſt is thruſt down, and made, as it were, a ſtepping ſtone for Self to come at it's point, and as a ſtirrup for Self to mount to the Saddle by; Self ſubordinats all things to it ſelf, and Chriſt among the reſt, and therefore, whoſoever would follow Chriſt, and live to him, muſt needs deny themſelves. 2ly. Conſider more particularly, the way wherin Chriſt calls his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers to walk, and the Duties that he requires of them, or the nature of the race that he wills
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:135228:61"/> them to run; and in every piece of it, we will find ſomething oppoſit and contradictory to Self; look to believing in Chriſt, it deſtroyes Self, neither can domining Selfineſs conſiſt with it, it quite excludes all boaſting on ſelfie accounts: Look to ſuffering for Chriſt, no man can <hi>take up the Croſs and follow Chriſt,</hi> ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l firſt <hi>he deny him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;</hi> will any man, unleſs he be ſelf-denyed in a conſiderable meaſure, think ye, hazard, or part with his Houſe, Land, Eſtate, Wife, Children, or Life, for that which carnal wiſdom and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Self will be ready to repreſent, but as a little momentuous matter: as <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid to our Lord, ſo it will be ready to ſay, <hi>Spare and pitie thy ſelf;</hi> No, ſays Chriſt to <hi>Peter,</hi> and to all his followers, reſolve <hi>to take up your Croſs, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me;</hi> and in order thereto, <hi>deny your ſelf,</hi> your eaſe, profit, pleaſure, credit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in a preſent World. 3ly. If we conſider the manner of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe Duties which Chriſt calls for, this qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification of them will be found to be neceſſary, yea, whether it be doing or ſuffering; we are called to follow him therein in a ſingle ſincere and denyed manner, if we would pleaſe him, not only to do Duty, but to do it from a right principle, and to a right end; not only to bear the Croſs, but to bear it patiently, and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully; will ever a man think ye follow and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour Chriſt that way, if he get not victory over himſelf? will he ſuffer the loſs of his Goods, and take the ſpoiling of them joyfully, if they be his Idol? will he ſuffer reproach for Chriſt, if he cannot indure to have the leaſt word ſpoken to the prejudice of his name, on any account? will he endure to be put to wandering up and down,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:135228:62"/> without any certain dwelling place, in hunger, and cold, and nakedneſs, if he be addicted to his eaſe, and pleaſure? or will he hazard his Life, or turn his back on Houſes, Lands, Wife, and Children, if his affections be inordinatly carried forth towards them? 4ly. Conſider tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the end which all Chriſts followers ſhould have before them, whether in doing, or ſuffering, is exceeding inconſiſtent with Selfineſs; for they are called to doing of Duties, in obedience to his command, and with regard to his honour, without incroaching, or trenching thereon; and when they have done all, and ſuffered to the yond moſt; they are not to eſteem of themſelves the more highly on that account, but to reckon themſelves the more oblidged to Chriſt, who hath thus helped, and honoured them; and not to be as the <hi>Phariſees who did all to be ſeen of men;</hi> They had two great ends before them, in all they did, which he will by no means endure in his followers; one was eſtimation and applauſe from men, the other ſome merited reward from God; Therefore, in oppoſition to theſe, Chriſt ſays, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.13. <hi>Let not thy left hand know what thy right hand does;</hi> in any good that ye do, be denyed to your ſelves, take no notice of it, as affecting eſtimation from it, as having confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in it, let not your ſelves think that ye have done ſome worthy deed; For this end makes Duties that are good in themſelves, to be as no Duties on Gods account; <hi>Ephraim</hi> is reput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an empty vine, when he brings forth fruit only to himſelf: Now before we come to the <hi>Uſe,</hi> take a word or two of Warning, or Caution; and 1. Conſider, that when we ſpeak of <hi>Selfineſs,</hi> or
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:135228:62"/> Self, we ſpeak not of it here, as it is taken for a ſinful corruption in man ſimply, and in it ſelf, but as it is lawful, yet venting it ſelf inordinatly, and ſo ſinfully; as a mans reſpect to his own well-being ſimply is lawful, but when it vents it ſelf, (as I ſaid) inordinatly, and ſinfully it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull, as when it comes in oppoſition to, or in competition with Chriſt, or any thing that is Chriſts; a man may, no doubt, lawfully ſeek to ſave his Life, or his Goods, or Name; but when it comes to this, that he muſt either hazard the loſs of theſe, or wound his own Conſcience, or the profeſſion of Religion, or deny Chriſt a teſtimony, when called for; in that caſe, he muſt be, as if he had not a Life, Goods, or Name; or Credit. 2ly. Conſider, That when we ſpeak of <hi>Self-denyal,</hi> it is not ſo to be underſtood, as if a man could be compleatly, &amp; perfectly denyed to himſelf, or as if he could be quite without the reach of being hurt by any Tentation to Selfineſs; for, ſo long as corrupt nature, in the remainder of it, is in men, there will never be abſolute perfection in Self denyal; but that which we mean is, that a man ſincerely ſtudy to mortifie all inordinat reſpect to himſelf; That when a tentation to it aſſaults, he endeavour honeſtly to repell and refute it, and with holy peremptori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs deny to grant what it ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ks, nay, to abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat it, as Chriſt doth, that ſinful and unſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able motion of <hi>Peters,</hi> for ſaving his Life; This is it that the ſaints are called to, even when the Tentation cometh, to ſuppreſſe, bear, and beat it down: Thus, our Lord, <hi>John</hi> 21.18. nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly reconciles theſe two, when he ſayes to <hi>Peter, When thou waſt young, thou girdedſt thy ſelf, and
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:135228:63"/> walkedſt whither thou wouldſt, but when thou ſhalt be old, thou ſhalt ſtretch forth thy hands, and another ſhall gird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldeſt not; thus he ſpoke, ſignifying by what death he ſhould glorifie God; Peter</hi> had a natural deſire, not to die a violent death and therefore in this reſpect, <hi>was led whither he would not;</hi> yet it is ſaid, that <hi>Peter,</hi> by laying down his life, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering a violent death, glorified God, becauſe the debate he had with Self was decided in Chriſts favours, (to ſpeak ſo) and the tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to pitie Self, was not hearkned to, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted and overcome.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>third</hi> place, according to the method propoſed, we come to to the <hi>Uſes</hi> of the Doctrine, which are <hi>three,</hi> the <hi>firſt</hi> whereof ſhews what is the Duty that the followers of Chriſt are called to. The <hi>Second</hi> exhorts to it. The <hi>Third</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves ſhort-coming in it, and diſcovers the riſe of this ſhort-coming.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Firſt Uſe</hi> then ſerves to ſhew the great Duty that the follower of Chriſt is called to, or what a Chriſtian ſhould be, even a Self-denyed man; If we follow the Duty in application, it will be found to comprehend many things; more generally. 1. It is a complication of all, or at leaſt of many Graces, and Duties, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s of Patience, Submiſſion, Singleneſs, Sincerity, Meekneſs, Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, or lowlineſs of Mind, thinking well, and highly of God, and meanly of our ſelves. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As it is a complication of many Graces, and Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; ſo 2ly. It is an antidot againſt many vices, and evils, againſt Pride, High conceit, Haſtineſs, Paſſion (which is not taken much heed to) Fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, Grudging, Diſcontentment, Diſquietneſs,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:135228:63"/> Anxiety, and many moe evils, which we will not now particularize; But ſhall more particul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly draw the <hi>Uſe</hi> to a few things, which the Scripture points at, and which a man muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily be denyed to, or elſe he is not fit to follow Chriſt. 1. He muſt be denyed to the principles of carnal Reaſon, to his own wit, to the counſel of fleſh and blood, he muſt not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult therewith (as the great Apoſtle tells us, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.16. he heeded it not, and which is one of the main things intended here;) he muſt not be much up nor down, with external conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies, or inconveniencies, or events, which carnal reaſon uſeth to ſtretch very broad. 2ly. He muſt be denyed to his credit and eſtimation, and in that, be like to a little Child; and in this reſpect, he that is Miniſter and Servant of all ſhall be greateſt of all; he muſt nor be like the <hi>Phariſees, who ſought the uppermoſt ſeats at feaſts, and greetings in the market,</hi> Nor love, or ſeek to be called <hi>Rabbi,</hi> but he muſt be content to bear reproach, and not to fret nor canker under it. 3ly, He muſt be denyed to his eaſe, outward ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation, or pleaſure; he muſt not ſeek to pleaſe himſelf; his great deſign muſt not be to have, or maintain an eaſie life to himſelf in the World; but he muſt be content, to accept of any condition God carves out to him herein. 4ly. He muſt be denyed to his profit, as he muſt be cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified to all creature-comforts in general, ſo to this in particular; he muſt not ſeek his own things only, but the things of others alſo. 5ly. He muſt be denyed to his own Righteouſneſs, Gifts, Priviledges and Parts, to his good works, and whatever is commendable, and good in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:135228:64"/> and ſo account of himſelf, as if he had them not, counting all theſe things to be but <hi>loſs and dung that he may win Chriſt, and be found in him.</hi> 6ly. He muſt be denyed to his own ſtrength and ability, and to Self-confidence, deadned to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good thing in himſelf, ſo as to reſt on it. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.9. <hi>We received</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>the ſentence of death in our ſelves, that we might learn not to truſt in our ſelves;</hi> Truſting in our ſelves, is a very ordinary fault, and it's a hard matter to go about Dutie, without lipning to our ſelves. 7ly. He muſt be denyed to all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinat love and affection, to all near and dear natural relations, to Wife, Huſband, Father, Mother, Children, Brother and Siſter,, yea, and to his own life alſo, however love to theſe be not only lawful, but a commanded and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable Duty, yet when they come in competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with Chriſt, and any concern of his, we muſt carry towards them, as if we hated them.</p>
            <p>The 2d <hi>Uſe</hi> ſerves for exhortation to this Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; Take, O take Chriſt for your Patern, and learn at him, to deny your ſelves, and let his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample be a motive to ſtir you up to it, as well as a Coppie and Patern for your imitation; For 1. Chriſt <hi>came not to do his own will, but the will of him that ſent him.</hi> 2ly. In all his converſation, <hi>he pleaſed not himſelf; but, as it is written, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches of them that reproached his father f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

In a word, look to him in his Birth, all along in his Life, in his Suffering, and Dying, there is nothing in all theſe, but it ſpeaks out ſomewhat of his denying himſelf: as all the ſteps and degrees of his humiliation, and ſtouping ſo very low, ſmells ſtrong of Self-denyal, ſo they ſerve to teach his Diſciples, how to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him in that way, and to provock and ſtir them up thereto: Therefore, in the name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, we exhort you to ſtudy this Leſſon well, and to learn it of him; even to live ſo in the World, as if there were nothing in it to tempt you; to live as if ye were dead, &amp; as if all were dead about you, in reſpect of being ſwayed by any inordinat reſpect to your ſelves; and ſo much the rather, becauſe, at this time, God ſeems to be calling more eſpecially to it, the Croſs being at our door, to which there will be no kindly ſtouping without <hi>Self-denyall,</hi> Men will not without this indure to be troubled with quartering of Souldiers in their houſes, let be to loſe all they have in the wor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>In the Words, we have <hi>three</hi> main things im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed. 1.

The Duty that Believers are called to in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the Croſs, and theſe afflictions that they are to meet with, <hi>Let him take up his croſs,</hi> and that <hi>dayly,</hi> as <hi>Luke</hi> hath it. <hi>Chap.</hi> 9.23. 3ly.

            <p>As for the <hi>firſt</hi> of theſe, it contains in it ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral things, as 1. That Believers are to reckon to meet with ſad afflictions, in following Chriſt, and no leſs than ſuch as are both painful and ſhameful, and accompanied with reproach, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared here to ſufferings on the Croſs. 2ly. That they are to lay their account to meet with theſe continually, they muſt reſolve to take up their Croſs <hi>dayly.</hi> 3ly. That there are (beſide the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral afflictions of the People of God) ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and peculiar to every one of them, every man is to have his ſhare of the publick, general, and common Croſses and Afflictions, and his particular Croſs beſide. 4ly. That they muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to meet with theſe, even in the following of Chriſt, and while they are in their Duty; we ſhal take in all theſe in this one Doctrine. <hi>That Believers, even in their following of Chriſt, and in the doing the Duties they are called to, are ordinar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accompanied with conſiderable croſſes, afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and difficulties;</hi> Chriſts Words laying it down, as a concluſion not to be controverted, that his followers muſt reſolve to bear the Croſs dayly, and with no leſs certification than that, otherwiſe they cannot come after him, give a very clear riſe to the Doctrine; and the truth of it being ſuch, that none do profeſſedly call it in queſtion, let be down-right deny it, that it might be judged unneceſſary and ſuperfluous, to offer at any proof of it; yet the practice of moſt calling for it as neceſſary, we ſhall ſpeak a little to the clearing, and confirming of the point; the truth whereof is manifeſted by the Scriptures of
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:135228:69"/> the Old and New Teſtament, and by the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the People of God, in all Ages: There are <hi>three</hi> ſorts of afflictions that the People of God meet with, &amp; that are ſpoken of in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. 1. Some that are properly chaſtiſements 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.32<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So the <hi>Corinthians</hi> are ſaid <hi>to be chaſtened of the Lord,</hi> for prophaning the Lords Table, <hi>That they may not be condemned with the world;</hi> Theſe are not the afflictions, ſo much at leaſt, meaned here. 2ly. Some are properly try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als that the people of God meet with, in follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their Duty, and not properly for their Duty, and while they are walking ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly; Such were holy <hi>Jobs</hi> afflictions, which he met with, while he was ſincerely and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, in a great meaſure about his Duty to God and man, very ſharp ones: neither are theſe ſo much intended here. 3ly. Some that Believers meet with from men, becauſe of their faithfull following, and cleaving cloſs to their Duty, while they ſuffer in their Eſtates, Perſons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for well-doing; Theſe are the Croſſes and Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons mainly meant here, though we would not exclude the former ſorts; they muſt reſolve, both in their Dutie, and for their Dutie, to meet with the Croſs, to be reproached and perſecut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; Take but one paſſage out of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44. <hi>v.</hi> 22. Where the People of God ſay to him, <hi>For thy ſake we are counted as ſheep for the ſlaughter, and all this is come upon us, yet have we not forgotten thee, neither have we dealt falſly in thy covenant:</hi> and this is ſo ordinary a Lot, that <hi>Paul</hi> cites it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.36. As a truth verified in his time, and to be verified in all times following; And if we come to the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:135228:69"/> beſide that juſt now mentioned, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. See 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.9. <hi>I thank God</hi> (ſayes the Apoſtle) <hi>he hath ſet forth us Apoſtles laſt, as it were appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to death, for we are a ſpectacle to the world, and to angels and men; we are fools for Chriſts ſake; but ye are wiſe; we are weak, but ye are ſtrong; ye are honourable, but we are deſpiſed; even unto this preſent hour, we both hunger and thirſt, and are naked, and buffeted, and have no certain dwelling place; being reviled, we bleſs; being perſecuted, we ſuffer; being defamed, we intreat, we are made as the filth of the world, and are as the off-ſcourings of all things unto this day.</hi> And ſee how he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larges this, as the way of his fighting, and doing Duty. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. <hi>In much patience, in afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, in neceſſities, in diſtreſſes, in ſtripes, and impriſonments, in tumults and labours,</hi> &amp;c. And 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.23. <hi>In labours more aboundant, in ſtripes above meaſure, in priſons more frequent, in deaths often, of the Jews I ſuffered five times fourtie ſtripes ſave one, thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I received ſhipwrack, a night and a day I have been in the depth, in journieing often, in perills by water, in perrills by robbers, in perills by my own countrey men, in perrills by the heathen, in perills in the city, in the wilderneſs, in the ſea, and by falſe brethren,</hi> &amp;c. So <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.32, 33. Where there is <hi>a great ſight of afflictions</hi> ſpoken of, <hi>Partly,</hi> while Believers were made <hi>a gazing-ſtock by reproaches, and afflictions, partly while they became compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of them who were ſo uſed; and ſuffered the ſpoil of their goods joyfully,</hi> and <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. <hi>through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out;</hi> How largely is this Doctrine followed forth,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:135228:70"/> 
               <hi>Chap.</hi> 12. And all the Cloud of believing Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes brought in, in the exerciſe of their Faith, walking thorow Sufferings; yea, it's ſo received a Truth, that in the Old and New Teſtament, we find it laid down (as it were) in Maximes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.19. <hi>Many are the afflictions of the right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eous: Acts.</hi> 14.22. <hi>Through much tribulation we muſt enter into the kingdom of God;</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.12. <hi>All that will live godly in Chriſt Jeſus ſhall ſuffer perſecution:</hi> No man that will reſolve to keep a good Conſcience but he muſt reſolve to have this for his Lot; and we find both the Old and New Teſtament joyned together, for verification of this Truth, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.29. <hi>But as then, he that was born after the fleſh, perſecuted him that was born after the Spirit, ſo is it now;</hi> Theſe that have nothing of Gods Grace in them, will ſtill perſecute thoſe that have it, the Seed of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent will always perſecute the Seed of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, ſo that the followers of Chriſt are not, even in their doing of Duty, exempted from Croſſes and Afflictions, and that of the ſharpeſt, and moſt ſearching nature: if it were needful to follow forth the confirmation of this by reaſons, ſeveral might be given, but take only a few of many, in ſome paſſages of Scripture; the <hi>first</hi> whereof, is, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.29. <hi>Whom he did fore-know thoſe he predeſtinat, to be conformed to the image of his Son;</hi> Who hath chalked out their way where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they muſt follow him through many afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to Glory, that ſo they may be made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to him, both in holineſs, and in ſuffering; which holy Image of his in them, is the Butt of the wicked worlds malice, and perſecution; I
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:135228:70"/> ſay, he makes uſe of afflictions, to further their ſpiritual conformity to him, who, as <hi>he learned obedience by ſuffering,</hi> (though he needed not) ſo Believers are brought up at the ſame School, that their haughtineſs may be laid, their dulneſs rouzed and helped, and they taught obedience. The 2d place and reaſon is, in <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.2, 3. Where <hi>Moſes</hi> gives this for a reaſon, why the Lord keeped <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſo long in the wilderneſs, even <hi>that he might humble them, and prove them, and know what was in their heart,</hi> &amp;c. Where <hi>first,</hi> we ſee that the deſign of afflictions is to humble Gods People; whileſt all things go well with them they are ready to be puft up, &amp; to think well of themſelves, and of their duties, but God brings on croſſes to put them upon a ſearch, and to make a diſcovery to them of their ſin, and ſo layes their pride, and in this reſpect there is a neceſſity of affliction. 2ly. That all afflictions come to prove the People of God, and to try what is in their heart; not ſo, but that God knows ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly what is in their heart, but he will needs have them to know it alſo; Believers are ready to ſay in their proſperity, (as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 35.) <hi>We ſhall never be moved;</hi> and never to think of being ſhaken; but God cauſeth, or permits a Croſs-wind to blow, and then ſomewhat comes whereof they did not think, and makes them change their tune, and ſay, <hi>Thou hide thy face, and I was troubled;</hi> And this is both profitable, &amp; needful that they may know that they are not ſo ſtable, and immovable as they imagined. 3ly. That they may know, <hi>That man lives not by bread only, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God;</hi>
               <pb n="132" facs="tcp:135228:71"/> That is, That man lives not ſo much by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward means, and ſecond cauſes, as by Gods bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing; which is another uſe and end of afflictions, even to bring his People off from leaning to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond cauſes and means, to a more immediat de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance on God himſelf; and to make them look beyond plowing, ſowing, harveſt, labour, our own diligence, pains, ſkill, prudent fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight, and fore-caſting, care and dexterous ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement, for through-bearing, direction, guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and proviſion in all things they ſtand in need of; for if proſperity went alwayes along with the Dutie, men would readily be by aſſed, and inclined to follow dutie for wrong ends; therefore the Lord will have it otherwiſe, that it may be known who they are that follow him, for proſperity attending duty, and who for the right end. The 3d and laſt place, (contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing another reaſon) which I ſhal name, is if that which we have, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.3. <hi>We glory in tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, knowing that tribulation worketh patience,</hi> &amp;c. We are not troubled at afflictions (as if he ſaid) becauſe we get ſo much good of them; and what is that good? Tribulation draweth forth Grace into exerciſe, and makes it to grow, which did before much languiſh, and in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner lye by; there are ſeveral Graces in a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, that are not (to ſay ſo) in ſuch a capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of acting, and being exerciſed, as when they are under the Croſs; what hath patience to do, that hath not affliction, and tribulation to try and exerciſe it? or how ſhal experience grow without patience? and how ſhal hope grow ſtrong and ſhine, where there is little or no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience?
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:135228:71"/> therefore Tribulation comes and works Patience, and Patience Experience, and Experience Hope; Tribulation not only affords occaſion and matter to Patience, but through Gods bleſſing works it, by tameing the Perſon, bringing low the height and haughtineſs of his Spirit, and making him put his mouth in the duſt; (and this is one good that comes by afflictions) and <hi>Patience</hi> again <hi>bringeth forth experience,</hi> when a man is brought to a ſuffering Lot, and by ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering calmed, and meekned, he gets many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences of Gods love, tender care, and vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant providence; that he would rather have than want his ſufferings; he gets the experience of Gods faithfulneſs, in making good his Promiſes, in ſuſtaining and bearing thorow under ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and as many troubles as he hath, he gets as many out-gates, neither would he want ſuch ſweet experience, whatever his Croſſes may be, that he falls under; and this is a <hi>Second</hi> Good that comes by affliction; a <hi>Third</hi> Good is, that <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience brings forth hope;</hi> For when Chriſtians are accuſtomed to afflictions, and find the good of them, and get freſh experience of Gods faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and love under them, they ſcar not ſo much at them; for the bleſſed out-gates that they have gotten before, give them ground to hope for moe; and this makes them pleaſantly, chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and couragiouſly to march through all their Af<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ictions and Tribulations.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Firſt Uſe</hi> ſerves, to diſcover the great unſuitableneſs of our practice to this Truth; There is not any Truth leſs controverted, nor more confirmed, How comes it then to paſſe,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:135228:72"/> that we look upon the Croſs, eſpecially when i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> comes for Duty, as it were a ſtrange and uncouth thing, whereof we had never heard before, or, as if God had oblidged himſelf to keep the Croſs from of us? <hi>Think it not ſtrange</hi> (ſayeth the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.12.) <hi>concerning the firie tryal, as if ſome ſtrange thing happened unto you;</hi> O! do not think your ſelves exempted from, or ſet quite without the reach of any Tryal, Affliction, or Tribulation that any of the People of God have met with before you, or in your time.</p>
            <p>The 2d. <hi>Uſe</hi> ſerves, to reprove our too great averſeneſs from, and ſtarting at Tryals, Croſſes, Afflictions, and Tribulations, Let us put our ſelves to it, and enquire how theſe two can ſtand together, to wit, the certainty of their ſuffering perſecution, that will live Godly, and our fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieing that a godly man, not only may, but muſt be free of perſecution? 2ly. if it be a certain truth, that the People of God muſt enter into his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom through much Tribulation,, how comes it to be ſo little believed, and that ſo very few are found laying their account with it in particular? Is not this undenyably evident, by ſo much ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully diſtempering fear of it, and ſeeking anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, and unwarrantably to ſhift and ſtave it off ere it come, by thinking ſhame of it, and freting under it, when it comes, and by impatient long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be freed from it? alas, theſe are ſhread and ſad evidences, that it is not really and throughly believed, that <hi>the kingdom of God muſt needs be entered into through much tribulation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The 3d. <hi>Uſe</hi> ſerves, to provock us to wonder, that ſeing Chriſt thus bargans and capitulats
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:135228:72"/> with all his followers, without exception, that <hi>they take up their croſs dayly and follow him,</hi> through the ſtraiteſt and darkeſt ſteps of trouble; we are ſo little actually put to it, for every day that we are free of ſome great Croſs, is more than condition, and ſpeaks Chriſt (to ſay ſo) to be better than his word; every day of ſuch freedom layes a new obligation on us, to be thankful, and to bear our little Croſſes the more patiently; to this purpoſe, the Apoſtle be ſpeaks the Chriſtian <hi>Hebrews, Chap.</hi> 12.4. <hi>Ye have not yet reſiſted unto blood, in ſtriving againſt ſin;</hi> It was bleſſed Jeſus his lot, and of multitude of his Martyrs to ſuffer to Blood and Death; ſhould we then, becauſe of our little pettie ſuffering, fret and be anxious? It's both our ſin and ſhame, it's but very little that we have yet ſuffered in compariſon of what we ſhould lay our account with, and in compariſon with what others have ſuffered; why then is there ſo much un-warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſnifting of ſuffering, and ſo much repineing and grudging under it, as if God dealt more hardly with us than with others?</p>
            <p>The 4th. <hi>Uſe</hi> ſerves for warning, That ſince laying account with ſuffering is ſo neceſſary, ye would not think of getting it ſhifted, going about too diligently, by carnal wiles to ſhift, becomes a ſnare to many; let never your ſelves think, that ye can live godly in Chriſt Jeſus, and eſcape all ſuffering and perſecution; if ye ſhift Chriſts Croſs ſinfully, ye will bring Chriſts curſe on you; This is the great guilt of the body of our Land, and of this Place, that many having in a manner, laid by the Croſs of Chriſt, dare hazard on the
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:135228:73"/> curſe of Chriſt without dread of it; This will be found to be a fooliſh exchange, it's far better, without all doubt, to follow Chriſt with the Croſs, than to meet him and the Curſe; they will never repent it, who have choſen affliction ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than Sin, and to follow Chriſt with the Croſs rather than to comply with any ſinful courſe or practice; O! how dreadful will it be to all them (under whatſoever ſpecious and plauſable like pretences they may do it) that have by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing to follow Chriſt, bearing his Croſs, run themſelves into the danger of his Curſe, the Lord ſave us from ſuch deſperat folly and madneſs.</p>
            <p>The 5th. and <hi>Laſt Uſe</hi> (which may be the <hi>First Doctrine,</hi> from the <hi>Second</hi> part of the Text, to wit, the Duty called for from Chriſts follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, which is, <hi>to take up their Croſs</hi>) is. <hi>That ſince there are none who ingadge to be followers of Chriſt, but muſt reſolve before hand, on whatſoever difficulties they may meet with in the way; and ſince the Croſs is ſo certain, they would not unſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſtrive againſt it, but prepare for to take it up, and carry it after him; what man,</hi> (ſaith our Lord, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.) <hi>going to build a houſe, ſits not down firſt to count the coſt; or, what king going to make war with another King, ſits not down firſt, to conſult, if he be able to meet with him,</hi> &amp;c. Where his Scope is ſo obviously to this purpoſe, that we need not ſay any thing more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to that notable paſſage; The reaſon of the Doctrine is, becauſe not only is the Croſs neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and unavoidable, but alſo becauſe thoſe are ſo fooliſh, as not to prepare for it before it come, will very readily be ſurpriſed with it, when it
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:135228:73"/> comes; if they be not by ſuch previous, ſerious forecaſt and reſolution at a point, eſtabliſhed, and ready armed to encounter the Croſs, when it marcheth up furiouſly againſt them, they will be taken at a great diſadvantage, and will not be able to ſtand it out, but will readily run, and be routed; hence it is, that in a day of tryal, ſo many miſcarry, and fall off. If it be here inquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed what I mean, by preparing for the Croſs ere it come? Ye may take it in theſe few directions; the <hi>Firſt</hi> whereof is, That we would indeavour to have our intereſt in Chriſt clear, otherwiſe it's hardly poſſible that we can indure the Croſs; hence it is, that the Apoſtle beſpeaks the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian <hi>Hebrews, Chap.</hi> 10. <hi>v.</hi> 34. <hi>Ye took joyfully the ſpoiling of your goods, knowing in your ſelves, that ye have in heaven a better and induring ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance;</hi> this was one main ground, on which they did ſo chearfully ſuffer the ſpoiling of their goods; the ſuitably indeavoured certainty of the one greatly facilitats the ſuffering of the other. 2ly. We would through Grace ſtudy to carry denyedly, in reference to all earthly injoyments and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts; we would, as the Apoſtle exhorts, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. <hi>v.</hi> 31. <hi>Uſe the world as not abuſing it;</hi> We would ſo uſe all things in the world, that we may not be brought under the power of any of them, holding a looſe grip of them all, ready to forego our hold of Wife, Children, Houſes, Lands, Money, even of all Relations, and Injoyments, as if they were none of ours, when the Lords calls to it; In a word, we would ſeek <hi>to be crucified with Chriſt, and to have the world crucified to us, and our ſelves crucified to
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:135228:74"/> the world,</hi> and weaned from it; a notable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration for bearing the Croſs. 3ly. We would ſtudy to be much taken up with the ſeriou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> thoughts of things not ſeen, to come, and eternal, to admit thoſe things to have great weight with us, and to be much converſant with them, even to have our hearts and our converſations in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; This was it that greatly influenced <hi>Moſes</hi> refuſal to be called the Son of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> daughter, and his choice of a ſhare of the People of God their affliction, even <hi>the reſpect that he had to the recompence of reward, Heb.</hi> 11.24, 25, 26. And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> gives this as a reaſon why he made ſo light account of affliction, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. <hi>While</hi> (ſayeth he) <hi>we look not at the things that are ſeen, but at the things that are not ſeen, for the things that are ſeen are temporal, but the things which are not ſeen are eternall;</hi> Few ſerious and ſtayed thoughts of Heaven, little delightful dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the contemplation of the approaching full manifeſtation of the glorious priviledges of the Sons of God, with much minding of earthly things and groveling in the earth, make the Croſs ſeem very terrible, and even intolerable; whereas heavenly mindedneſs, and much looking at things unſeen and eternal, notably ward off the dint of the blowes of afflictions, that they do not much get in on the heart, to divert from following of Chriſt, by anxious and vexatious thoughts about them. 4ly. We would ſtudy to be much in fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſting of, and in acquainting our ſelves with the ſaddeſt difficulties ere they come; not looking at our ſelves, as exeemed from the heavieſt and moſt ſadly circumſtantiated afflictions that any of
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:135228:74"/> Gods People have met with; Thus ſhal that which is leſs be the better born, unjuſt ſhame &amp; reproach will not be thought ſo very much of, neither will there be ſuch ſtartling at a croſs word, nay, not at Bonds and Impriſonment, and ſpoiling of Goods, when we have laid our account in our thoughts to meet with the greateſt afflictions: God hath hitherto keeped the greateſt part of us from any very conſiderable perſonal Tryalls, and Tribulations, and we are ready to look at theſe as being quite worn out of uſe; but we would bring them near, and habituat our ſelves in our thoughts to them, and by Chriſtian bearing leſſer ones, be fitting our ſelves againſt the coming of the great Croſs and Tryal; if we cannot indure little pettie Tryals, ſuch as a frown, a check, or a word of reproof from others, how will we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have, when it comes to greater Sufferings if the running with Foot-men weary us, how will we be able to contend with Horſes? if we faint in the land of peace, what will we do, when it comes to the flowings of <hi>Jordan?</hi> 2ly. When many of you are upon every trifling occaſion, chideing; jangling and brauling in your Families, and every ſmal matter awakens Paſſion; and when we are not learning Chriſtianly to bear the ſmalleſt things, how can we expect to be able to bear the greateſt Croſſes? It were very deſirable, that we made it our ſtudy to accuſtome our ſelves dayly to bear our little Croſſes ſuitably; when injuries are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to us, though we be not called to be out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly ſenſleſs under them, yet we would learn to carry them with Chriſtian meekneſs, and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; but when men allow themſelves in their

As 1. The great good that comes by willing, ready and chearful taking up, and bearing of Chriſts Croſs, ſuch as the try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and improvement of Graces, furthered con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to Chriſt, acceſs to glorifie him, much of the Spirit of God, and of Glory reſting on the Sufferer, the honeſt Sufferer for Chriſt, even all the peaceable fruits of Righteouſneſs, that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward wait on them that are exerciſed thereby; It's true, no affliction is for the preſent joyous, but grievous, and even the Believer in Chriſt may find difficultie, yea, not only ſo, but much averſneſs, and reſiſtance from the unrenewed part, but the regenerat part makes him patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and pleaſantly to ſtoup; Thus the Lord ſayes of <hi>Peter, That he ſhould be carried whither he would not;</hi> There was in him not only a purely natur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all

A 2d. Thing that confirmeth, and preſſeth this, is, not only the great good and benefit that cometh to us by it, which makes <hi>Paul to glorie in the midſt of tribulations</hi> and <hi>James</hi> to exhort Chriſtians, <hi>to count it all joy when they fall into divers tentations;</hi> but alſo the great and honourable priviledge that is in being count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed worthy to ſuffer for his name, <hi>rejoyce</hi> (ſayes <hi>Peter) in as much as ye are partakers of Chriſts ſufferings:</hi> And if we conſider a little more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, we will find, that there are a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny priviledges, that wait honeſt and chearful Sufferings for Chriſt, beſide all the good of it. As namely 1. When God puts the honour on ſome to be inſtrumental in high and honourable pieces of ſervice to him, particularly in ſuffering for him, which is moſt honourable; giving them not only to believe in Chriſt, but alſo to ſuffer for his ſake, (as it is, <hi>Philip.</hi> 1.29. Where there is an obſervable gradation) all Believers have not this honour. 2dly. There is a meaſure of myſtical Chriſts Sufferings to be filled up; For as Chriſt is not compleat without his body, the Church, ſo his Sufferings in that reſpect are not compleat till that appointed meaſure be filled up. So, <hi>Col.</hi> 1, 24. Believers are ſaid, <hi>to fill up what is behind of the ſufferings of Christ</hi> myſtical, and there is thereby a great priviledge, and piece of honour put
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:135228:76"/> upon them; It's true, their Sufferings are nei<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther meritorious nor ſatisfactory to Divine Juſtice that is already done to their hand, it being the peculiar and incommunicable priviledge of the perſonal ſufferings of Chriſt, but to be joyned with him in the ſame work, in order to the ſam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> general end, <hi>viz.</hi> The glorifying of God, is, doubtleſs a great honour. A 3d. Priviledge is, that Believers Sufferings for Chriſt make way according to Gods diſpoſal, and order of things, for more eminent degrees of Glory, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.11.12. It's true, they merit none, yet he hath in his wiſdom ordered that connection, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, that <hi>if we ſuffer with him, we ſhall alſo reign with him;</hi> and <hi>if we ſuffer with him, that we ſhall alſo be glorified together with him,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.12. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.17. And ſays the Lord to his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.28, 29. To this purpoſe, <hi>Ye are they that have continued with me in my tentations, and I appoint unto you a kingdom,</hi> &amp;c. It is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed by way of merit, but by way of connection, that much Suffering is recompenſed with much Glory: <hi>It's a righteous thing with God</hi> (ſays the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.6. <hi>to render tribulation to them that trouble you, and to you that are troubled reſt with us;</hi> There is a ſort of Righteouſneſs, in mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much Suffering for Chriſt to be followed with much Glory, ſo that though the Saints right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſneſs, be a righteouſneſs of Grace, yet there is ſomewhat in Gods Righteouſneſs, and equal, or ſuitable way of dealing, that me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>y reſteth upon you.</hi> A 5th Priviledge is, That Sufferers for Chriſt are ſomeway equalled to the moſt eminent Saints, Prophets and Apoſtles, that have gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them; To this purpoſe, ſays our Lord to his Diſciples, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 11, 12. <hi>Bleſsed are ye when men ſhal revile, and perſecute you; for ſo did they perſecut the Prophets that were before you;</hi> And to be dealt with as all the great men of God, and the Prophets before us were, and to be put in the ſame rank, roll, and catalogue with them, is no ſmall Priviledge, nor is it any little honour, for ſuch poor creatures as we are, to be thus highly ranked, and claſſed. There is a 3d thing that confirmeth, and preſſeth the Point, and that is, the Fountain whence this willing taking up, and chearful bearing of Chriſts Croſs flowes, which is, the believing contemplation, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the Love of God in Chriſt, of the faithfulneſs of his Promiſe, and Covenant, and of his tender Fatherly care, and pity towards his Children; <hi>Ye have forgotten,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.5. <hi>the exhortation that ſpeaks to you, as to Children; My ſon, deſpiſe not thou the chaſtning of the Lord, neither faint when thou art rebuked of him.</hi> (Importing, that they had forgotten the nature of affliction, and of the relation that they ſtood in to God, when they fainted under the Croſs,) <hi>For whom the Lord loveth, he correcteth,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:135228:77"/> and chaſtneth every ſon whom he receiveth, and if ye indure chaſtiſments, ye are dealt with as Sons,</hi> &amp;c. As if he had ſaid, Gods ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
